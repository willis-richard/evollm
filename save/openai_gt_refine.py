# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy  1. **Start by playing Defect (D).**  2.
# **Switch to Cooperate (C) if the opponent plays Cooperate (C) for 2
# consecutive rounds.**    - This allows for earlier mutual cooperation,
# maximizing potential payoffs sooner.  3. **If the opponent defects (D) after
# you switch to Cooperate (C), switch back to Defect (D) for 3 rounds as
# punishment.**    - After 3 rounds of Defect (D), return to Cooperate (C) to
# test if the opponent is willing to cooperate again.  4. **If the opponent
# defects (D) again after you return to Cooperate (C), switch to permanent
# Defect (D) for the rest of the game.**    - This prevents repeated
# exploitation by an uncooperative opponent.  5. **If the opponent alternates
# between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), always play Defect (D).**    - This
# avoids being exploited by inconsistent behavior.  6. **In the final 10 rounds
# of the game, always play Defect (D).**    - This accounts for the endgame,
# where defection becomes more advantageous as the game approaches its
# conclusion.  This revised strategy balances aggression with opportunities for
# cooperation, while also incorporating forgiveness and an endgame plan.

# willingness to cooperate and establish a foundation for mutual benefit.  2.
# **Continue playing C as long as your opponent plays C**: If your opponent
# continues to cooperate by playing C, keep playing C to maintain the mutual
# payoff of 3.  3. **Defect (play D) if your opponent defects (plays D)**: If
# your opponent defects, immediately switch to playing D in the next round to
# discourage further defection.  4. **Punish consistent defection**: If your
# opponent defects for two consecutive rounds, continue defecting until they
# return to cooperation. This prevents exploitation by a consistently
# uncooperative opponent.  5. **Forgive occasional defection**: If your opponent
# defects only once and then returns to cooperation, forgive them by returning
# to cooperation (C) in the next round. This allows for recovery from occasional
# mistakes or tests of trust.  6. **Monitor patterns of defection**: If your
# opponent alternates between cooperation and defection in a predictable
# pattern, adjust by defecting in response to their defection and cooperating
# only when they cooperate. This prevents exploitation by opponents who try to
# game the system.  7. **Defect in the final round only**: To avoid being
# exploited at the end of the game, defect (play D) in the final round. However,
# continue cooperating in the penultimate rounds if your opponent is still
# cooperating, as this maximizes the potential for mutual benefit before the
# final round.  This revised strategy balances cooperation with a more robust
# response to consistent defection, while still allowing for occasional
# forgiveness and adaptation to the opponent's behavior.

# previous round, play C.    - If your opponent played D in the previous round,
# play D **once** in retaliation.    - After retaliating with D, return to C in

# continue to defect, repeat the process (defect once, then return to C).  3.
# **Endgame (Final 10 Rounds)**: In the last 10 rounds, always defect (play D).
# ---  **Key Adjustments**: - The forgiveness mechanism is now gradual, with a
# single defection in response to the opponent's defection, followed by a return

# starts later (in the final 10 rounds) to maximize cooperative gains before the

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for 1000-Round Iterated Game  1. **Start with
# Defect (D)**: In the first round, always play D. This avoids the risk of being
# exploited early and sets an aggressive tone.  2. **Defect (D) as Long as the
# Opponent Defects (D)**: If the opponent plays D in any round, continue playing
# D. Mutual defection yields 1 point each, which is better than risking 0 points
# by cooperating while the opponent defects.  3. **Switch to Cooperate (C) if
# the Opponent Cooperates Twice in a Row (C, C)**: If the opponent plays C for
# two consecutive rounds, switch to C in the next round to test for the
# possibility of mutual cooperation. This avoids missing out on the higher
# payoff of 3 points each from mutual cooperation.  4. **Return to Defect (D)
# Immediately if the Opponent Defects After You Cooperate**: If you switch to C
# and the opponent defects (D) in any subsequent round, immediately return to D
# in the next round. This punishes the opponent for exploiting your cooperation
# and prevents further losses.  5. **Maintain Mutual Cooperation (C) if the
# Opponent Continues to Cooperate**: If both you and the opponent continue to
# play C for several rounds, maintain cooperation to maximize the 3-point payoff
# per round. This is the optimal outcome if the opponent is willing to
# cooperate.  6. **Defect (D) in the Last 3 Rounds**: In the final three rounds,
# always defect. Since future retaliation is irrelevant, defecting ensures you
# avoid being exploited and potentially gain 5 points if the opponent continues
# to cooperate.  7. **Adapt to Opponentâ€™s Strategy**: If the opponent
# consistently alternates between C and D or shows a clear pattern, adjust your
# strategy accordingly. For example, if the opponent plays tit-for-tat, mirror
# their moves to maintain cooperation and avoid unnecessary defection cycles.
# ---  This revised strategy addresses the critiques by focusing on maximizing
# long-term cooperation when possible, punishing defection consistently, and
# adapting to the opponentâ€™s behavior. It also avoids unnecessary risks,
# especially in the endgame.

# **In subsequent rounds, follow a "Tit-for-Tat" approach with a slight
# modification:**    - If your opponent cooperated (C) in the previous round,
# you also cooperate (C) in the current round.    - If your opponent defected
# (D) in the previous round, you defect (D) in the current round.  3. **Forgive
# occasional defections cautiously:**    - If your opponent defects once but
# then returns to cooperation (C) in the next round, you forgive and return to
# cooperation (C) as well.    - However, if the opponent alternates between
# defection (D) and cooperation (C) repeatedly, you defect (D) to prevent
# exploitation.  4. **Punish repeated defections proportionally:**    - If your
# opponent defects for **two consecutive rounds**, defect (D) for two rounds in
# response. After that, return to cooperation (C) if the opponent cooperates (C)
# again.  5. **Introduce a mechanism to escape mutual defection:**    - If both
# you and your opponent have defected (D) for **three consecutive rounds**,
# attempt to break the cycle by cooperating (C) in the next round. If the
# opponent also cooperates, continue cooperating. If they defect again, return
# to defection.  6. **Endgame consideration:**    - In the final 10 rounds,
# gradually shift towards defection (D) if the opponent shows signs of
# defection. However, if mutual cooperation has been consistent throughout the
# game, continue cooperating to maximize the final payoffs.  7. **Adapt to
# opponent behavior:**    - If the opponent consistently defects without
# returning to cooperation, switch to permanent defection (D) after 5 rounds of
# repeated defection to avoid being exploited.  This revised strategy addresses
# the potential pitfalls of mutual defection, exploitation, and the endgame
# problem while maintaining a cooperative approach when possible.

# cooperation after defection. This prevents predictable exploitation.  This
# revised strategy balances punishment and forgiveness, avoids long defection
# loops, and adapts to different opponent behaviors while maximizing the

# retaliation.  3. **Conditional Forgiveness**: If your opponent defects (plays
# D) once, forgive them by playing C in the next round, but only if they
# cooperated in at least 3 of the last 5 rounds. This encourages cooperation
# while preventing exploitation by frequent defectors.  4. **Punish Consistent
# Defection**: If your opponent defects in two consecutive rounds, switch to
# permanent defection (D) until they cooperate again. This prevents being
# exploited by an opponent who consistently defects.  5. **Endgame
# Consideration**: In the last 10 rounds, switch to defection (D) if your
# opponent has defected more than 30% of the time up to that point. This
# prevents late-game exploitation when the opponent may try to maximize their
# own payoff by defecting.  ### Summary: - Start by cooperating. - Mirror your
# opponentâ€™s previous move. - Forgive a single defection if the opponent has
# shown a pattern of cooperation. - Punish consistent defection by defecting
# until cooperation is restored. - Defect in the final rounds if the opponent
# has a history of frequent defection.

# Plays C:** If the opponent plays C, continue defecting (D) to maximize your
# payoff (5 for you, 0 for them). This exploits cooperative opponents early on.
# 3. **Punish Defection with Defection (D):** If the opponent defects (D),
# respond with defection (D) to avoid being exploited. Continue defecting as
# long as the opponent defects to ensure you donâ€™t fall behind in points.  4.
# **Probe for Cooperation After Mutual Defection:** After 3 consecutive rounds
# of mutual defection (both playing D), switch to cooperation (C) for one round
# to test if the opponent is willing to cooperate. If the opponent responds with
# C, continue cooperating (C) to maximize mutual payoffs (3 each round).  5.
# **Return to Defection (D) if the Opponent Defects After Cooperation:** If the
# opponent defects (D) after youâ€™ve established cooperation, immediately return

# Opponent Alternates:** If the opponent alternates between defection and
# cooperation, mirror their behavior by alternating as well. This prevents them
# from gaining an advantage while maintaining the possibility of cooperation.
# 7. **In the Final 5 Rounds, Always Defect (D):** In the last 5 rounds, always
# defect (D) to maximize your payoff, as future retaliation becomes irrelevant.
# This revised strategy maintains an aggressive approach but introduces
# mechanisms to test for cooperation, punish defection effectively, and avoid
# prolonged mutual defection. It also reduces predictability by shortening the

# previous round, both you and your opponent played C, play C again.  3.

# any round, respond by playing D (defect) in the next round. If the opponent
# continues to defect, escalate by continuing to defect until they return to
# cooperation.  4. **Forgive after opponent returns to cooperation**: If your
# opponent plays C after defecting, return to cooperation (C) in the next round.
# However, if the opponent defects again soon after, escalate the punishment by
# defecting for two consecutive rounds before returning to cooperation.  5.
# **Escalate further for repeated defections**: If the opponent defects multiple
# times in a short period (e.g., within 5 rounds), increase the punishment
# duration by defecting for an additional round each time they defect again
# (e.g., defect for 2 rounds, then 3 rounds, etc.).  6. **Reset after sustained
# cooperation**: If both players cooperate for 10 consecutive rounds, reset the
# punishment escalation, treating the opponent as if they are fully cooperative
# again.  This revised strategy introduces escalating punishment for repeated
# defections, discourages exploitation, and provides a mechanism to reset after
# sustained cooperation, balancing cooperation and deterrence.

# round).  3. **Cooperate if Opponent Cooperates**: Once you switch to
# cooperation, continue cooperating as long as your opponent also cooperates.
# This helps establish a mutually beneficial relationship (3 points per round
# for both).  4. **Punish Defection with Temporary Defection**: If your opponent
# defects while you are cooperating, respond by defecting for **two rounds**.
# This punishes the defection but leaves room for the opponent to return to
# cooperation. After two rounds of defection, return to cooperation if the
# opponent also cooperates.  5. **Occasional Defection to Test Opponentâ€™s
# Commitment**: After a stable period of cooperation (at least 10 consecutive
# rounds of mutual cooperation), defect **once** to test your opponentâ€™s
# willingness to continue cooperating. If they respond with cooperation, return
# to cooperation immediately. If they defect, punish with two rounds of
# defection, then attempt to re-establish cooperation.  6. **Endgame Strategy**:
# In the final 10 rounds, defect in **every other round** (starting with
# defection) to maximize your payoff while still leaving some room for
# cooperation. This prevents the opponent from fully anticipating a complete
# defection strategy and may allow for some cooperative rounds.  ### Summary of
# Key Conditions: - Start with defection and continue until the opponent defects
# twice in a row. - Cooperate if the opponent cooperates, but punish defection
# with two rounds of defection. - Occasionally test cooperation with a single
# defection after a long period of mutual cooperation. - In the final 10 rounds,
# defect every other round to balance maximizing payoff and maintaining some
# cooperation.  This revised strategy balances aggression with opportunities for
# cooperation, while also addressing the need to recover from mutual defection
# and avoid overly predictable behavior.

# ### Revised Strategy: **Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Forgiveness**
# 1. **Start with Cooperation (C)**: In the first round, play C to signal a
# willingness to cooperate.  2. **Mirror the Opponent's Last Move**: From the
# second round onward, play the same move your opponent made in the previous
# round:    - If they played C, you play C.    - If they played D, you play D.
# 3. **Conditional Forgiveness**: If the opponent defects (plays D) but has
# cooperated in at least 70% of the previous 10 rounds, forgive them by playing
# C in the next round. This encourages cooperation while preventing exploitation
# by frequent defectors.  4. **Punish Persistent Defection**: If the opponent
# defects in 3 consecutive rounds, continue playing D until they cooperate
# again. This ensures that persistent defectors are punished more severely.  5.
# **Endgame Caution**: In the last 3 rounds (rounds 998, 999, and 1000),
# continue to mirror the opponentâ€™s last move rather than automatically playing
# C. This prevents exploitation in the final rounds while still allowing for
# cooperation if the opponent remains cooperative.  This revised strategy
# addresses the critiques by making forgiveness conditional on the opponent's
# overall behavior, punishing persistent defectors more effectively, and
# avoiding vulnerability in the endgame.

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for the Iterated Game  1. **Start with
# Defection (D) in the first round.**    - This maintains an aggressive stance
# initially, but leaves room for adaptation.  2. **In the next 3 rounds, mirror
# the opponent's previous move.**    - If they play C, respond with C in the
# next round. If they play D, respond with D. This allows you to test the
# opponent's willingness to cooperate without committing too early.  3. **If the
# opponent cooperates (C) for 3 out of the first 4 rounds, switch to cooperation
# (C) in the 5th round.**    - This opens the door to mutual cooperation
# earlier, maximizing potential payoffs.  4. **If the opponent defects (D) more
# than once in the first 4 rounds, continue defecting (D) until they show
# consistent cooperation (C) for 3 consecutive rounds.**    - This ensures you
# are not exploited while still allowing for a shift to cooperation if the
# opponent changes their behavior.  5. **If the opponent defects (D) after you
# switch to cooperation (C), return to defection (D) for 2 rounds, then test
# cooperation (C) again.**    - This punishes defection but allows for recovery
# from potential mistakes or exploratory defections by the opponent.  6. **If
# the opponent continues to defect (D) after the 2-round punishment, maintain
# defection (D) for the remainder of the game.**    - This prevents further
# exploitation if the opponent is consistently uncooperative.  7. **If the
# opponent consistently cooperates (C) after the 2-round punishment, return to
# cooperation (C) and maintain it as long as they do.**    - This maximizes the
# mutual payoff while allowing for forgiveness and recovery from occasional
# defections.  This revised strategy balances aggression with flexibility,
# allowing for early cooperation if the opponent shows willingness, while still
# punishing defection and preventing exploitation. It also accounts for
# potential mistakes or exploratory defections by the opponent, offering
# opportunities for recovery.

# continues to defect after you start playing D, keep playing D until they
# return to cooperation (play C). This ensures that persistent defection is met
# with sustained punishment.  5. **Forgive after opponent returns to
# cooperation**: If your opponent plays C after a period of defection, return to
# playing C in the next round. This allows cooperation to resume but only after
# the opponent demonstrates a willingness to cooperate.  6. **Monitor for
# alternating defection patterns**: If your opponent alternates between

# opponents who try to take advantage of alternating strategies.  This revised

# ### Revised Neutral Strategy for Iterated Game (1000 Rounds)  1. **Start with
# Cooperation (C)**: In the first round, play C to signal a willingness to
# cooperate, but be prepared to adjust based on the opponent's response.  2.
# **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**: From the second round onwards, mirror the
# opponent's last move. If they play C, you play C. If they play D, you play D.
# However, if the opponent defects (plays D) once, forgive them by playing C in
# the next round to test if they return to cooperation.  3. **Forgiveness
# Window**: If the opponent returns to cooperation (C) within 1 round after
# defecting, continue cooperating (C). If they defect again immediately after
# your forgiveness, switch to defection (D) until they show consistent
# cooperation for at least 2 consecutive rounds.  4. **Respond to Persistent
# Defection**: If the opponent defects (plays D) for 4 or more consecutive
# rounds, switch to defection (D) for the remainder of the game, as they are
# likely committed to exploiting you.  5. **Endgame Defection Adjustment**: In
# the final 3 rounds, defect (D) regardless of the opponent's actions, as
# cooperation is less likely to be reciprocated in the very last rounds. This
# minimizes the risk of being exploited at the end while still allowing for
# cooperation in most of the game.  This revised strategy balances cooperation,
# forgiveness, and defection more flexibly, while also adjusting the endgame
# defection timing to avoid premature loss of cooperative payoffs.

# plays C, continue playing C.**      - Maintain cooperation as long as the
# opponent cooperates, ensuring both players consistently score 3 points per
# round.  3. **If your opponent plays D (defects), immediately switch to D in
# the next round.**      - Punish defection swiftly to prevent exploitation, but
# do not overcommit to defection.  4. **After one round of mutual defection
# (both playing D), switch back to C to test for cooperation.**      - This
# allows for recovery from misunderstandings or occasional defections, giving
# the opponent a chance to return to cooperation.  5. **If the opponent responds
# to your cooperative test with C, continue playing C.**      - Reward their
# return to cooperation by re-establishing mutual cooperation.  6. **If the
# opponent defects again after your cooperative test (i.e., you play C and they
# play D), switch to D and continue defecting for the next 3 rounds.**      -
# This escalates the punishment for repeated defection, signaling that continued
# betrayal will not be tolerated.  7. **After 3 rounds of mutual defection, test
# cooperation again by playing C.**      - This gives the opponent another
# opportunity to return to cooperation, but with a stronger deterrent against
# further defection.  8. **If the opponent continues to defect after multiple
# cooperative tests, defect for the remainder of the game.**      - At this
# point, the opponent has shown they are not willing to cooperate, so maximize
# your score by defecting consistently.  9. **In the final 10 rounds, defect
# only if the opponent has defected in the previous round.**      - Avoid
# predictable defection in the final rounds to prevent the opponent from
# exploiting you early. If they continue cooperating, maintain cooperation to
# maximize mutual payoffs.  This revised strategy balances an initial
# cooperative approach with a measured response to defection, allowing for
# recovery from occasional betrayals while punishing consistent defection. It

# of their move.  4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After punishing with one round
# of defection, return to cooperation (play C) immediately, even if the opponent
# continues to defect. This gives the opponent a chance to re-establish
# cooperation.  5. **Adaptation to Consistent Defection**: If your opponent
# defects for **five consecutive rounds**, switch to always defecting (play D)

# **Occasional Cooperation Test**: If you have switched to always defecting due
# to consistent defection by the opponent, test their willingness to cooperate
# by playing C once every 50 rounds. If they respond with C, return to the Tit-
# for-Tat strategy.  ---  This revised strategy balances cooperation and
# punishment, introduces a forgiveness mechanism, and adapts to consistently
# uncooperative opponents while still allowing for the possibility of re-
# establishing cooperation.

# Defection**:      - If your opponent defects once (i.e., plays **D** while you
# played **C**), forgive them by playing **C** in the next round. This
# encourages them to return to cooperation. However, only forgive once in a row.
# 4. **Punish Persistent Defection**:      - If your opponent defects two times
# in a row (i.e., plays **D** in two consecutive rounds), switch to **D** and
# continue defecting until they return to cooperation. This prevents
# exploitation by persistent defectors.  5. **Return to Cooperation After Mutual
# Defection**:      - If both you and your opponent have played **D** in the
# last round, return to **C** in the next round to give them a chance to
# cooperate again. However, if they defect again after this, follow the
# punishment rule (step 4).  6. **Never Defect First**:      - Always maintain
# cooperation unless your opponent defects first. This ensures you are not the
# one initiating conflict.  This revised strategy balances cooperation with a
# more robust response to persistent defection, reducing the risk of
# exploitation while still allowing for recovery of cooperation after occasional
# defections.

# inconsistent behavior.  3. **Punish Persistent Defection More Aggressively:**
# If your opponent defects for two consecutive rounds, switch to playing D for
# **three consecutive rounds** to punish persistent defection. This increases
# the cost of defection for the opponent and discourages repeated exploitation.
# 4. **Adapt to Opponent Behavior:** If the opponent alternates between
# cooperation and defection frequently (e.g., every other round), switch to
# playing D consistently until they demonstrate a clear pattern of cooperation
# for at least three consecutive rounds. This prevents the opponent from
# exploiting predictable tit-for-tat behavior.  5. **Final 20 Rounds - Shift to
# Defection Earlier:** In the last 20 rounds, begin to defect more frequently.
# Start by defecting every third round, then gradually increase the frequency of
# defection as the game approaches the final 10 rounds. In the last 5 rounds,
# defect consistently to maximize your payoff, as cooperation becomes less
# valuable near the end.  6. **Adjust for Random or Irrational Opponents:** If
# the opponentâ€™s behavior appears random or irrational (e.g., no discernible
# pattern of cooperation or defection), switch to playing D consistently after
# the first 10 rounds to avoid being exploited by unpredictable behavior.  This
# revised strategy incorporates stricter forgiveness, more aggressive punishment
# for persistent defection, and an earlier shift to defection in the final
# rounds, while also accounting for the possibility of facing random or
# irrational opponents.
