# 1. **Start by defecting (D) in the first round**. This sets an aggressive tone
# and maximizes the payoff if the opponent cooperates initially.  2. **Continue
# defecting (D) as long as the opponent cooperates (C)**. This exploits
# cooperative opponents, ensuring you score 5 while they score 0.  3. **If the
# opponent defects (D), defect (D) for the next 2 rounds**. This punishes their
# defection but avoids locking both players into long-term low payoffs.  4.
# **After 2 rounds of mutual defection, switch to cooperate (C) for 1 round**.
# This tests whether the opponent is willing to return to cooperation.  5. **If
# the opponent cooperates (C) in response, continue cooperating (C) as long as
# they do**. This ensures both players can consistently score 3, which may be
# beneficial in the long run.  6. **If the opponent defects (D) again after your
# cooperation, defect (D) for the rest of the game**. This signals that repeated
# defection will not be tolerated and prevents further exploitation.  7. **In
# the last 10 rounds, defect (D) regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions**. This
# ensures you maximize your payoff in the endgame, where cooperation is less
# likely to be reciprocated.  This revised strategy maintains an aggressive
# approach while simplifying the punishment phase and reducing the risk of being
# exploited. It also accounts for the endgame, where defection becomes more
# advantageous.

# of 3 per round.  3. **Punish defection with escalation**: If the opponent
# plays D (defects), respond by playing D in the next round. However, if the
# opponent defects again within the next 5 rounds, increase the punishment by
# defecting for 2 consecutive rounds. Continue escalating the punishment by
# adding one more round of defection for each subsequent defection within a

# punishment and forgiveness cycle, with escalating punishments for repeated
# defections.  In summary: Start with cooperation, reciprocate cooperation,
# punish defection with escalating defections if the opponent continues to
# defect, and forgive after a defection-free period to encourage a return to

# ### Revised Strategy: Conditional Cooperation with Proportional Retaliation
# 1. **Start by cooperating (C) in the first round.**    - This sets a
# cooperative tone and encourages mutual cooperation from the outset.  2.
# **Continue cooperating as long as your opponent cooperates (plays C).**    -
# If both players consistently play C, you each score 3 per round, maximizing
# long-term payoffs.  3. **If your opponent defects (plays D), retaliate by
# defecting (play D) for two consecutive rounds.**    - This proportional
# retaliation discourages sporadic defections by making the cost of defection
# higher, while still allowing for a return to cooperation.  4. **Return to
# cooperation (play C) after two rounds of retaliation, unless your opponent
# defects again.**    - This shows a willingness to forgive and re-establish
# cooperation, but the increased retaliation period makes it clear that
# defection has consequences.  5. **If your opponent continues defecting, keep
# defecting (play D) until they cooperate again.**    - This prevents further
# losses from continuous exploitation and ensures youâ€™re not taken advantage of
# in a series of defections.  6. **In the final 10 rounds, defect (play D)
# regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions.**    - This prevents exploitation in the
# endgame, where opponents might defect knowing retaliation is less costly near
# the end.

# If your opponent continues to defect for 3 consecutive rounds, play *Defect

# (C)* in the next round.  This revision simplifies the forgiveness rule by
# making it adaptive to the opponent's behavior rather than based on an
# arbitrary round count. It maintains neutrality by mirroring the opponent's

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for Iterated Normal-Form Game (1000 rounds):
# 1. **Start by Defecting (D) in the first 5 rounds.**      This establishes a
# clear aggressive stance and tests the opponent's willingness to cooperate or
# retaliate.  2. **Observe the opponent's response:**    - If the opponent
# **continues to play Cooperation (C)** despite your defection:      - **Defect
# (D) for the rest of the game.**          The opponent is overly cooperative,
# allowing you to maximize your payoff by consistently exploiting them.     - If
# the opponent **retaliates by playing Defection (D)** in response to your
# defection:      - **Switch to Cooperation (C) for the next 5 rounds.**
# This tests whether the opponent is willing to establish mutual cooperation
# after initial conflict.  3. **After switching to Cooperation (C):**    - If
# the opponent **also switches to Cooperation (C)** and maintains it:      -
# **Continue to cooperate (C) consistently** as long as the opponent does.
# This maximizes long-term payoffs through mutual cooperation.     - If the
# opponent **continues to defect (D)** even after your cooperation:      -
# **Return to consistent Defection (D) for the remainder of the game.**
# The opponent is uncooperative, so mutual defection is the best way to avoid
# being exploited.  4. **In the final 10 rounds:**      - **Defect (D) in every
# round.**        As the game nears its end, defection maximizes short-term
# gains with minimal risk of retaliation.  ### Summary: - Start with defection
# to establish an aggressive tone. - If the opponent is overly cooperative,
# continue defecting. - If the opponent retaliates, test for cooperation and
# reciprocate if they cooperate. - Defect consistently if the opponent remains
# uncooperative. - Defect in the final 10 rounds to secure maximum payoffs.

# defection immediately.  3. **Occasional Forgiveness**: After every **5 rounds
# of mutual defection** (both players playing **D**), **return to cooperation**
# (play **C**) regardless of the opponent's move. This prevents long cycles of
# mutual defection and gives the opponent a chance to return to cooperation.  4.

# continue cooperating to maximize long-term gains.  This revised strategy
# simplifies the forgiveness mechanism, reducing the risk of exploitation while
# still promoting cooperation and avoiding prolonged defection cycles.

# Shift**: Continue the Tit-for-Tat strategy consistently through all 1000

# Start cooperative. - Mimic your opponent's actions throughout the entire game.

# ### Revised Aggressive Iterated Strategy  1. **Start by Defecting (D)**: In
# the first round, always play D to establish an aggressive stance and test your
# opponentâ€™s response.  2. **Defect Until Punished**: Continue playing D as long
# as your opponent cooperates (plays C). This maximizes your early gains.  3.
# **Switch to Cooperation (C) After Punishment**: If your opponent defects (D)
# after previously cooperating (C), interpret this as a punishment. In the next
# round, switch to cooperation (C) to test if they are willing to cooperate
# again.  4. **Return to Defection If Cooperation Fails**: If your opponent
# continues to defect (D) after you switch to cooperation, immediately return to
# defection (D) and stay there. This signals that you will not tolerate one-
# sided defection.  5. **Maintain Cooperation If Reciprocated**: If your
# opponent responds to your cooperation with cooperation (C), continue
# cooperating (C) as long as they do. This allows for mutual benefit if the
# opponent is willing to cooperate.  6. **Endgame Strategy (Final 5 Rounds)**:
# In the last 5 rounds, switch to pure defection (D) regardless of your
# opponentâ€™s behavior. This ensures you maximize your final payoffs without
# concern for future retaliation.  ---  ### Key Adjustments: - **Simplified
# Conditions**: The strategy now has fewer conditional checks, making it simpler
# to follow. - **Aggressiveness Maintained**: The strategy remains aggressive by
# starting with defection and only switching to cooperation if punished. -
# **Reduced Risk of Over-Defection**: The strategy now allows for cooperation if
# the opponent signals willingness, reducing the risk of mutual punishment
# cycles. - **Shorter Endgame Defection**: The final defection phase is reduced
# to the last 5 rounds, balancing the need for maximizing payoffs while
# minimizing unnecessary defection.

# ### Revised Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Controlled Retaliation  1. **Start with
# cooperation**: In the first round, play **C** (cooperate).  2. **Mirror your
# opponent's last move**: In each subsequent round, play exactly what your
# opponent played in the previous round. If they played **C**, play **C**. If
# they played **D**, play **D**.  3. **Forgive occasional defection
# cautiously**: If your opponent defects (**D**) once, retaliate by defecting
# (**D**) in the next round. However, if they return to cooperation (**C**)
# after that, immediately return to cooperation as well. This ensures that
# occasional defections are punished but cooperation can quickly resume.  4.
# **Punish repeated defection**: If your opponent defects twice in a row or
# more, continue defecting (**D**) until they cooperate for two consecutive
# rounds. This ensures that persistent defection is met with sustained
# retaliation, discouraging exploitation.  5. **Endgame caution**: In the last
# 10 rounds, continue to mirror your opponentâ€™s moves rather than always
# cooperating. This prevents exploitation in the final rounds while still
# allowing for cooperation if the opponent remains cooperative.  This revised
# strategy maintains a cooperative approach while addressing potential
# exploitability by introducing more cautious forgiveness and a stronger
# response to repeated defections. It also avoids predictable behavior in the
# endgame.

# your opponent played C on the previous round, play C.    - If your opponent

# Opponent's Behavior**:    - If the opponent defects (plays D) **three times in
# a row**, defect (play D) on the next round, regardless of their move.    -
# After this defection, return to mirroring their last move as described in Step
# 2.  ### Summary of Rules: - Begin with cooperation. - Mirror the opponentâ€™s
# previous move on each round. - Defect only if the opponent defects three times
# consecutively, then return to mirroring.  ### Key Changes: - Removed the fixed
# defection every 50th round to avoid predictability and unnecessary complexity.
# - Introduced adaptive defection based on the opponent's behavior to maintain
# neutrality and avoid being exploited by frequent defectors.

# the opponent plays C in response to your D at least **three times** during
# these rounds, switch to C in round 6 to test for sustained cooperation.    -
# If the opponent plays D consistently during this phase, continue playing D.
# 3. **Exploitation Phase (Rounds 6-1000):**      - **If the opponent cooperates
# frequently (plays C often):**        Defect (D) **every round** to fully
# exploit their cooperation. This maximizes your payoff by taking advantage of
# their willingness to cooperate.       - **If the opponent defects frequently
# (plays mostly D):**        Continue defecting (D) every round to avoid being
# exploited by their defection.  4. **Adjustment Rule:**      - If the opponent
# shifts behaviorâ€”e.g., starts cooperating after defectingâ€”test their
# cooperation by playing C once. If they continue cooperating, return to
# defecting (D) every round to exploit them.    - If they return to defecting,
# continue playing D every round.  This revised strategy simplifies the
# approach, maintains a consistently aggressive stance, and maximizes
# exploitation of cooperative opponents without introducing unnecessary

# strategy.  ---  This version simplifies the punishment system, maintains

# **Revised Aggressive Strategy:**  1. **Round 1: Defect (D)** â€“ Start by

# willingness to cooperate.  2. **Rounds 2 to 100:**    - If the opponent plays
# C in the previous round, **Defect (D)** to exploit their cooperation.    - If
# the opponent plays D in the previous round, **Defect (D)** again to maintain
# an aggressive posture and discourage cooperation.  3. **Rounds 101 to 500:**
# - If the opponent has mostly cooperated (more than 70% of their moves were C),
# **Cooperate (C)** for 5 consecutive rounds to test if mutual cooperation can
# be established.    - If the opponent continues to cooperate during these 5
# rounds, **alternate between C and D every 5 rounds** to balance exploitation
# and cooperation.    - If the opponent defects during the 5-round test,
# **Defect (D) continuously** for the remainder of this phase.  4. **Rounds 501
# to 950:**    - **Defect (D) continuously** to maximize your score, as the
# opponent may retaliate, but the payoff from D is still better than C against
# D.  5. **Final 50 rounds (Rounds 951 to 1000):**    - **Defect (D) in every
# round** to ensure the highest possible payoff, as there is no future
# opportunity for retaliation from the opponent.  ---  **Key Adjustments:** -
# Simplified the strategy by removing unnecessary cycles of cooperation and
# defection. - Maintained an aggressive approach by focusing on defection, but
# introduced a brief test for cooperation in the middle phase to exploit
# potential mutual gains. - Reduced predictability by alternating between
# cooperation and defection only if the opponent shows consistent cooperation. -
# Ensured the final rounds are purely aggressive to maximize payoff without
# concern for future retaliation.

# played C in the previous round, continue playing C in the next round. This
# maintains mutual cooperation and maximises long-term payoffs.  3. **Punish
# defection with a single round of defection**: If your opponent plays D
# (defect) while you play C, respond by playing D in the next round. This
# discourages defection while keeping the punishment proportional.  4. **Return
# to cooperation immediately after punishment**: After one round of defection in
# response to their defection, return to playing C. This signals a willingness
# to cooperate again and avoids unnecessary escalation.  5. **Defect only if
# sustained defection is observed**: If your opponent defects for three
# consecutive rounds, switch to playing D indefinitely. This prevents long-term
# exploitation in a non-cooperative scenario.  6. **Forgive occasional
# defection**: If your opponent defects occasionally but returns to cooperation
# after your one-round punishment, continue returning to cooperation yourself.
# Occasional defection may be exploratory, and forgiveness fosters long-term
# cooperation.  **Summary**: Start by cooperating, punish defection with one
# round of defection, then return to cooperation. Defect indefinitely only if
# the opponent defects for three consecutive rounds.

# **Forgive After a Single Defection:** If your opponent defects (plays D) once,
# forgive them by playing C in the next round. After this forgiveness, return to
# mimicking their last move.  4. **No Permanent Defection:** Do not switch to
# permanent defection. Always continue to mimic the opponentâ€™s last move, even
# if they defect multiple times in a row. This ensures neutrality and avoids
# overreaction.  This revised strategy simplifies the forgiveness mechanism,
# maintains neutrality by consistently mirroring the opponent, and avoids
# locking into permanent defection, which could harm long-term payoffs.

# If the opponent plays C, switch to cooperation (C) in the next round to test
# their willingness to cooperate.  3. **Punish Immediately After Opponent
# Defects:** If the opponent defects (D) after you switch to cooperation,
# immediately revert to defection (D) and continue defecting for the next 5
# rounds. After 5 rounds, test cooperation again by playing C once.  4. **Defect
# More Frequently if Opponent Alternates:** If the opponent alternates between C
# and D unpredictably, defect (D) 80% of the time and cooperate (C) 20% of the
# time. This ensures you exploit their cooperation while minimizing your own
# vulnerability.  5. **Endgame Defection:** In the last 10 rounds, defect (D)
# every time, regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions. This maximizes short-term
# payoff as the game nears its conclusion.  This revised strategy simplifies the
# conditions for cooperation, maintains a strong aggressive approach, and
# clarifies the punishment mechanism. It also ensures a consistent endgame

# the opponent defects first.  This revised strategy maintains simplicity and
# cooperative behavior while addressing the potential weakness of being
# exploited by alternating defection. The escalation of punishment discourages
# repeated defection, and the requirement for sustained cooperation before
# forgiveness ensures more stable cooperation.

# establishing cooperation if the opponent is willing to cooperate again.  This

# once but returns to cooperation in the next round, forgive them by playing C
# (cooperate) again. This encourages mutual cooperation after brief disruptions.
# 4. **Retaliate if Exploited**: If the opponent defects twice in a row,
# continue defecting (D) until they return to cooperation. Once they cooperate,
# immediately return to cooperation as well.  5. **No Planned Defections**:
# Avoid any pre-planned defections (e.g., every 100 rounds). Only defect in
# response to the opponentâ€™s defection to maintain a neutral stance.  6.
# **Endgame Consistency**: Continue the tit-for-tat strategy until the final
# round. Do not switch to all-out defection at the end, as this could provoke
# unnecessary retaliation and reduce overall payoffs.  ---  This revised
# strategy is simpler, more neutral, and avoids unnecessary defections, focusing

# mimic your opponent's previous move:    - If your opponent played C in the
# previous round, play C.    - If your opponent played D in the previous round,
# play D.  3. **Forgiveness Mechanism:** If the opponent defects (plays D) and
# you respond by playing D in the next round, return to cooperation (play C)
# after one round of mutual D, regardless of their action, to test if they are
# willing to cooperate again.  4. **Punish Continuous Defection with Temporary
# Defection:** If the opponent defects (plays D) for three consecutive rounds,
# switch to defection (D) for the next three rounds. After this, return to
# cooperation (C) to test if the opponent is willing to cooperate again.  5.
# **Final Rounds:** Continue the Tit-for-Tat strategy until the very last round.
# On the final round, defect (play D) to maximize your payoff, as there is no
# future retaliation possible.  ---  This revised strategy simplifies the
# approach, maintains a more neutral stance by avoiding permanent defection, and
# ensures a balance between cooperation and self-protection.

# - If your opponent plays **D** in response to your **D**, continue playing
# **D** (defect) in the next round. Do not switch to **C** after mutual
# defection.  3. **Switching to cooperation**:    - If your opponent
# consistently plays **C** for 3 consecutive rounds after you have defected,
# switch to **C** (cooperate) to test for potential long-term cooperation.
# 4. **After playing C**:    - If your opponent plays **C** after you switch to
# **C**, continue playing **C** until they defect.    - If your opponent plays
# **D** after you switch to **C**, immediately return to playing **D** and
# continue playing **D** for the rest of the game.  This revised strategy
# maintains an aggressive stance by continuing defection after mutual defection
# and only switches to cooperation after observing consistent cooperative
# behavior from the opponent. It also ensures that defection is punished with
# permanent defection, aligning with the aggressive approach.

# your opponent played D in the previous round, respond by playing D in the next
# round.  3. **Forgive a single defection:**    - If your opponent defects
# (plays D) once but then returns to playing C in the next round, forgive the
# defection and return to playing C.    - If your opponent defects more than
# once in a row, continue playing D until they return to playing C for two
# consecutive rounds.  4. **Endgame caution:**    - In the final 10 rounds,
# continue using the Tit-for-Tat approach (responding to the opponentâ€™s last
# move) rather than always playing C, to avoid being exploited in the closing
# rounds.  ---  This revision simplifies the forgiveness rule, ensures logical
# consistency, and addresses the vulnerability in the endgame by maintaining a

# ### Revised Neutral Iterated Game Strategy  1. **Begin with Cooperation (C):**
# Start the game by playing C in the first round to signal a willingness to
# cooperate.  2. **Tit-for-Tat with Limited Forgiveness:**    - **If** your
# opponent played C in the previous round, **play C** in the current round.    -
# **If** your opponent played D in the previous round, **play D** in the current
# round (retaliate).  3. **Forgive Once After Retaliation:**    - After
# retaliating with D once, **return to C** in the next round **only if** your
# opponent plays C in response to your retaliation.    - **If** your opponent
# plays D again after your retaliation, **continue playing D** until they play
# C.  4. **Sustain Cooperation:**    - If your opponent consistently plays C
# after your forgiveness, **continue playing C** to maintain mutual cooperation.
# 5. **Detect and Punish Persistent Defection:**    - **If** your opponent plays
# D three times consecutively, **switch to permanent D** for the remainder of
# the game to avoid further exploitation.  This revised strategy simplifies the
# forgiveness process, reduces vulnerability to exploitation, and maintains
# neutrality by balancing cooperation and defection based on the opponent's
# behavior.
