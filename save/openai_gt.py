# ### Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Occasional Defection  1. **Start by cooperating
# (play C).**  2. **On the next round and every round thereafter:**    - If your
# opponent cooperated (played C) in the previous round, cooperate (play C).    -
# If your opponent defected (played D) in the previous round, defect (play D) in
# the next round.  3. **Occasionally defect to test your opponent**:    - Every
# 50 rounds, regardless of your opponent's previous move, play D (defect) once.
# This is to test if your opponent is overly cooperative and to maximise your
# potential payoff.  4. **Return to cooperation** if the opponent returns to
# cooperation after your occasional defection. Follow the standard tit-for-tat
# approach again.  ### Summary: - Start with cooperation, mirror your opponent's
# last move, and inject a defection every 50 rounds to probe for opportunities
# to exploit.

# ### Strategy: **Tit-for-Two-Tats with Initial Cooperation**  1. **Start by
# playing C (Cooperate) in the first two rounds.**    - This sets a cooperative
# tone and avoids immediate conflict.  2. **Continue to play C (Cooperate) as
# long as your opponent plays C in both of the last two rounds.**    - This
# rewards consistent cooperation from your opponent.  3. **If your opponent
# plays D (Defect) in either of the last two rounds, play D (Defect) in the next
# round.**    - This punishes occasional defection without overreacting to a
# single instance.  4. **Return to C (Cooperate) after one round of playing D if
# your opponent resumes playing C.**    - This allows for recovery of
# cooperation after brief punishment.  5. **If your opponent defects in two or
# more consecutive rounds, continue playing D until they start cooperating for
# two consecutive rounds.**    - This prevents exploitation by punishing
# sustained defection while still allowing a path back to cooperation.  ###
# Summary: - Start cooperatively and maintain cooperation unless your opponent
# defects multiple times. - Punish defection moderately but be quick to return
# to cooperation if your opponent shows willingness to cooperate again.

# ### Neutral Strategy for 1000-round Iterated Game  1. **Start with Cooperation
# (C):** In the first round, always play C to establish a cooperative tone.  2.
# **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness:**    - If your opponent played C in the
# previous round, continue playing C.    - If your opponent played D in the
# previous round, respond with D in the next round.    - **Forgive after one
# retaliation:** If you retaliated with D and your opponent returns to playing
# C, immediately return to playing C in the following round.  3. **Occasional
# Random Cooperation:**    - Every 50 rounds, regardless of the opponentâ€™s
# previous move, randomly play C with a 10% probability, even if you would
# otherwise have played D. This introduces uncertainty and prevents long-term
# cycles of mutual defection.  4. **Endgame Cooperation (final 10 rounds):**
# - In the last 10 rounds, always play C to signal cooperation and attempt to
# increase the overall payoff if your opponent decides to reciprocate.  This
# strategy balances between cooperation and retaliation, ensuring you don't
# suffer constant exploitation while allowing opportunities for rebuilding
# cooperation.

# opponent plays C in response to your D, continue playing D to maximize your
# score while they continue to cooperate.  3. **Switch to cooperation (C) if the
# opponent defects (D)**: If the opponent defects in response to your D, switch
# to playing C in the next round to signal potential future cooperation and test
# whether they are willing to switch to mutual cooperation.  4. **Defect again
# if mutual cooperation is not established**: If the opponent continues to play
# D after your switch to C, return to playing D and stick with it, as
# cooperation is unlikely to yield good results.  5. **Maintain mutual
# cooperation if established**: If the opponent cooperates after you switch to
# C, continue cooperating to sustain a mutually beneficial outcome.  6. **Punish
# defection with defection**: If at any point during mutual cooperation the
# opponent defects, immediately switch back to D and continue defecting until
# cooperation is restored.  7. **Endgame strategy**: In the final few rounds
# (e.g., the last 10 rounds), defect consistently regardless of the opponent's
# actions to maximize your score before the game ends.  This strategy balances
# aggression with opportunistic cooperation and ensures high payoffs in
# scenarios where the opponent is either cooperative or easily exploitable.

# Form Game:**  1. **Start with Defection (D):** Begin the first round by
# playing D to test if the opponent tends to cooperate or defect.  2. **Continue
# Defecting (D) if Opponent Cooperates (C):** If the opponent plays C while you
# play D, continue defecting in subsequent rounds to exploit their cooperation
# and maximize your score (5 points per round).  3. **Switch to Cooperation (C)
# if Opponent Defects (D) Consistently:** If the opponent responds to your
# defection with D for 3 consecutive rounds, switch to cooperation (C) to avoid
# the low payoff of mutual defection (1 point per round) and see if they begin
# cooperating.  4. **Return to Defection (D) if Opponent Defects after Your
# Cooperation:** If the opponent defects again while you're cooperating,
# immediately switch back to defection (D) to avoid being exploited.  5. **Tit-
# for-Tat but Aggressively:** After the first handful of rounds, mirror the
# opponent's previous move but with a bias towards defection. If the opponent
# cooperates, defect once to maximize your gain, but then cooperate in the
# following round to attempt to reset mutual cooperation. If they defect, return
# to defection.  6. **Endgame Aggression (Final 10 Rounds):** In the last 10
# rounds, defect consistently regardless of the opponent's behavior to maximize
# points, as there is no future punishment for defection.  This strategy
# aggressively pursues high payoffs through defection while still allowing some
# cooperation to prevent being locked in mutual defection for too long.

# short-term gain.  3. **Switch to Cooperation if Opponent is Consistently
# Cooperative:** If your opponent plays C for 5 rounds in a row without
# defecting, switch to playing C as well. This signals a willingness to
# cooperate and capitalize on mutual cooperation if the opponent is trustworthy.
# 4. **Defect Immediately After Opponent Defects:** If you are cooperating
# (playing C) and your opponent defects (plays D) even once, immediately return
# to defection (play D). This punishes the opponent for trying to exploit you.
# 5. **Forgive but Return to Defection if Betrayed Again:** If the opponent
# defects once after a long stretch of cooperation, give them one chance by
# returning to cooperation after 5 rounds of mutual defection. If they defect
# again after this, continue defecting for the rest of the game to avoid further
# losses.  6. **Endgame Defection:** In the final 10 rounds, defect consistently

# gain when future cooperation is irrelevant.  This strategy exploits opponents
# who are too cooperative while still offering the chance for mutual long-term

# move**: From round 2 onwards, play exactly what your opponent played in the
# previous round.    - If the opponent played C, play C.    - If the opponent
# played D, play D.  3. **Forgive occasional defections**: If the opponent
# defects (plays D) after a long series of cooperation (e.g., at least 5
# consecutive rounds of both playing C), forgive the defection and return to
# cooperating (play C) on the next round. This gives the opponent a chance to
# return to cooperation after an isolated defection.  4. **Punish persistent
# defection**: If the opponent defects for two consecutive rounds, switch to
# defection (play D) and continue defecting until the opponent returns to
# cooperation (plays C). Once they cooperate again, mirror their move as usual.
# 5. **Endgame cooperation**: In the last 5 rounds, always cooperate regardless
# of past behavior to maximize potential mutual benefit in the final rounds.
# This prevents a spiral of mutual defection as the game nears its end.  ###
# Summary: - Start by cooperating. - Mirror the opponent's last move. - Forgive
# a single defection after long cooperation. - Defect after two consecutive
# defections but return to cooperation if they do. - Cooperate in the final 5
# rounds.

# ### Aggressive Strategy for a 1000-Round Iterated Game:  1. **Start by playing
# D (Defect) in the first round.**    - This sets an aggressive tone and tests
# your opponentâ€™s responsiveness.  2. **In subsequent rounds, play D (Defect)
# again unless the opponent consistently plays C (Cooperate) for three
# consecutive rounds.**    - If the opponent plays C three times in a row,
# switch to C in the next round to test for mutual cooperation.     3. **If
# mutual cooperation (both playing C) is established, continue playing C as long
# as the opponent continues to play C.**    - This allows you to capitalize on
# the payoff of 3 points each round for as long as cooperation holds.  4.
# **Immediately switch back to D if the opponent defects (plays D) at any
# point.**    - Once the opponent defects, play D for the remainder of the game
# unless the opponent re-establishes cooperative behavior for another three
# consecutive rounds.  5. **In the final 5 rounds, always play D regardless of
# prior cooperation.**    - This ensures you maximize points toward the end of
# the game, where the opponent may attempt to defect for a final advantage.  ---
# This strategy balances an aggressive approach with the opportunity to exploit
# cooperation if the opponent is willing. It punishes defection quickly but
# leaves room for returning to mutual cooperation if it benefits overall payoff.

# opponent's previous move.**      - If they played C (cooperate) in Round 1,
# you play C in Round 2.      - If they played D (defect) in Round 1, you play D
# again in Round 2.  3. **Continue mirroring until Round 10.**      - For rounds
# 3 to 10, continue to copy your opponent's previous move. This will establish a
# pattern of reciprocity and signal that you are willing to mirror their
# behavior.  4. **Round 11: Defect regardless of their move.**      - In Round
# 11, defect again, regardless of your opponent's previous action. This
# introduces unpredictability and tests their willingness to cooperate.  5.
# **Rounds 12-30: Return to mirroring their previous move.**      - After the
# defection in Round 11, go back to copying your opponentâ€™s previous move for
# the next 18 rounds. This reinforces the idea that you're willing to cooperate
# if they do, but will retaliate if they defect.  6. **Round 31: Defect again.**
# - In Round 31, defect regardless of their move. This again tests their resolve
# and willingness to cooperate over the long run.  7. **Rounds 32-100: Continue
# mirroring their move but defect every 20th round.**      - For rounds 32 to
# 100, mirror their previous move but make sure to defect on every 20th round
# (i.e., rounds 51, 71, and 91).  8. **Rounds 101-1000: Mirror but defect every
# 50th round.**      - For the remainder of the game, continue the strategy of
# mirroring your opponentâ€™s previous move, but defect on every 50th round (i.e.,
# rounds 150, 200, 250, etc.).  9. **Final 10 rounds (Rounds 991-1000): Defect
# every round.**      - In the last 10 rounds, defect every round to maximize
# your final payoff, regardless of your opponent's actions.  This strategy is
# aggressive, as it starts with defection and periodically injects defection
# throughout the game, while still maintaining an overall cooperative approach.
# It aims to maximize overall payoff by exploiting cooperation when possible but
# occasionally taking advantage of the defect option.

# previous action. This gives the opponent an opportunity to return to

# ### Neutral Strategy for Maximizing Payoff in a 1000-Round Iterated Game  1.
# **Initial Move**: Start by playing **C** (cooperate) in the first round. This
# sets a cooperative tone and encourages mutual benefit.  2. **Tit-for-Tat
# Basis**: For each subsequent round, mimic your opponentâ€™s last move:    - If
# your opponent played **C** in the previous round, play **C** in the current
# round.    - If your opponent played **D** in the previous round, play **D** in
# the current round.  3. **Occasional Forgiveness**: Every 10 rounds, if your
# opponent has consistently defected (played **D**), attempt to re-establish
# cooperation by playing **C** once. This gives your opponent a chance to switch
# back to cooperation.  4. **Punishment for Sustained Defection**: If your
# opponent continues to defect for 5 consecutive rounds after an attempt at
# forgiveness, switch to playing **D** for the remainder of the game to minimize
# losses.  5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the final 5 rounds, always play
# **D** regardless of your opponentâ€™s behavior, as there is no future incentive
# to maintain cooperation.  ---  This strategy balances the potential for
# cooperative gains with cautious retaliation and forgiveness. It adapts to the
# opponentâ€™s behavior while ensuring protection against sustained exploitation.

# to Cooperation (C) if Opponent Defects Twice in a Row:** If your opponent
# plays D for two consecutive rounds, switch to C to test if mutual cooperation
# can increase your overall score.  4. **Return to Defection (D) if Opponent
# Defects After You Cooperate:** If you play C and your opponent responds with
# D, immediately switch back to D and continue defecting for the rest of the
# game against that opponent.  5. **Alternate Strategy if Opponent Cooperates
# After Defection:** If after your initial defection, your opponent switches to
# D and then starts cooperating after a few rounds, mirror their strategy by
# alternating between C and D to create uncertainty and prevent them from
# settling on pure cooperation.   6. **Endgame Aggression:** In the final 50
# rounds, defect consistently (D) regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions to
# maximize your payoff in the closing stages of the game.  This strategy
# leverages early aggression to test the opponent's willingness to cooperate,
