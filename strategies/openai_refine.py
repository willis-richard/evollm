# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy  1. **Start by playing Defect (D).**  2.
# **Switch to Cooperate (C) if the opponent plays Cooperate (C) for 2
# consecutive rounds.**    - This allows for earlier mutual cooperation,
# maximizing potential payoffs sooner.  3. **If the opponent defects (D) after
# you switch to Cooperate (C), switch back to Defect (D) for 3 rounds as
# punishment.**    - After 3 rounds of Defect (D), return to Cooperate (C) to
# test if the opponent is willing to cooperate again.  4. **If the opponent
# defects (D) again after you return to Cooperate (C), switch to permanent
# Defect (D) for the rest of the game.**    - This prevents repeated
# exploitation by an uncooperative opponent.  5. **If the opponent alternates
# between Cooperate (C) and Defect (D), always play Defect (D).**    - This
# avoids being exploited by inconsistent behavior.  6. **In the final 10 rounds
# of the game, always play Defect (D).**    - This accounts for the endgame,
# where defection becomes more advantageous as the game approaches its
# conclusion.  This revised strategy balances aggression with opportunities for
# cooperation, while also incorporating forgiveness and an endgame plan.

# willingness to cooperate and establish a foundation for mutual benefit.  2.
# **Continue playing C as long as your opponent plays C**: If your opponent
# continues to cooperate by playing C, keep playing C to maintain the mutual
# payoff of 3.  3. **Defect (play D) if your opponent defects (plays D)**: If
# your opponent defects, immediately switch to playing D in the next round to
# discourage further defection.  4. **Punish consistent defection**: If your
# opponent defects for two consecutive rounds, continue defecting until they
# return to cooperation. This prevents exploitation by a consistently
# uncooperative opponent.  5. **Forgive occasional defection**: If your opponent
# defects only once and then returns to cooperation, forgive them by returning
# to cooperation (C) in the next round. This allows for recovery from occasional
# mistakes or tests of trust.  6. **Monitor patterns of defection**: If your
# opponent alternates between cooperation and defection in a predictable
# pattern, adjust by defecting in response to their defection and cooperating
# only when they cooperate. This prevents exploitation by opponents who try to
# game the system.  7. **Defect in the final round only**: To avoid being
# exploited at the end of the game, defect (play D) in the final round. However,
# continue cooperating in the penultimate rounds if your opponent is still
# cooperating, as this maximizes the potential for mutual benefit before the
# final round.  This revised strategy balances cooperation with a more robust
# response to consistent defection, while still allowing for occasional
# forgiveness and adaptation to the opponent's behavior.

# previous round, play C.    - If your opponent played D in the previous round,
# play D **once** in retaliation.    - After retaliating with D, return to C in
# the next round to test if the opponent is willing to cooperate again. If they
# continue to defect, repeat the process (defect once, then return to C).  3.
# **Endgame (Final 10 Rounds)**: In the last 10 rounds, always defect (play D).
# ---  **Key Adjustments**: - The forgiveness mechanism is now gradual, with a
# single defection in response to the opponent's defection, followed by a return
# to cooperation to test their willingness to cooperate. - The endgame defection
# starts later (in the final 10 rounds) to maximize cooperative gains before the

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for 1000-Round Iterated Game  1. **Start with
# Defect (D)**: In the first round, always play D. This avoids the risk of being
# exploited early and sets an aggressive tone.  2. **Defect (D) as Long as the
# Opponent Defects (D)**: If the opponent plays D in any round, continue playing
# D. Mutual defection yields 1 point each, which is better than risking 0 points
# by cooperating while the opponent defects.  3. **Switch to Cooperate (C) if
# the Opponent Cooperates Twice in a Row (C, C)**: If the opponent plays C for
# two consecutive rounds, switch to C in the next round to test for the
# possibility of mutual cooperation. This avoids missing out on the higher
# payoff of 3 points each from mutual cooperation.  4. **Return to Defect (D)
# Immediately if the Opponent Defects After You Cooperate**: If you switch to C
# and the opponent defects (D) in any subsequent round, immediately return to D
# in the next round. This punishes the opponent for exploiting your cooperation
# and prevents further losses.  5. **Maintain Mutual Cooperation (C) if the
# Opponent Continues to Cooperate**: If both you and the opponent continue to
# play C for several rounds, maintain cooperation to maximize the 3-point payoff
# per round. This is the optimal outcome if the opponent is willing to
# cooperate.  6. **Defect (D) in the Last 3 Rounds**: In the final three rounds,
# always defect. Since future retaliation is irrelevant, defecting ensures you
# avoid being exploited and potentially gain 5 points if the opponent continues
# to cooperate.  7. **Adapt to Opponentâ€™s Strategy**: If the opponent
# consistently alternates between C and D or shows a clear pattern, adjust your
# strategy accordingly. For example, if the opponent plays tit-for-tat, mirror
# their moves to maintain cooperation and avoid unnecessary defection cycles.
# ---  This revised strategy addresses the critiques by focusing on maximizing
# long-term cooperation when possible, punishing defection consistently, and
# adapting to the opponentâ€™s behavior. It also avoids unnecessary risks,
# especially in the endgame.

# **In subsequent rounds, follow a "Tit-for-Tat" approach with a slight
# modification:**    - If your opponent cooperated (C) in the previous round,
# you also cooperate (C) in the current round.    - If your opponent defected
# (D) in the previous round, you defect (D) in the current round.  3. **Forgive
# occasional defections cautiously:**    - If your opponent defects once but
# then returns to cooperation (C) in the next round, you forgive and return to
# cooperation (C) as well.    - However, if the opponent alternates between
# defection (D) and cooperation (C) repeatedly, you defect (D) to prevent
# exploitation.  4. **Punish repeated defections proportionally:**    - If your
# opponent defects for **two consecutive rounds**, defect (D) for two rounds in
# response. After that, return to cooperation (C) if the opponent cooperates (C)
# again.  5. **Introduce a mechanism to escape mutual defection:**    - If both
# you and your opponent have defected (D) for **three consecutive rounds**,
# attempt to break the cycle by cooperating (C) in the next round. If the
# opponent also cooperates, continue cooperating. If they defect again, return
# to defection.  6. **Endgame consideration:**    - In the final 10 rounds,
# gradually shift towards defection (D) if the opponent shows signs of
# defection. However, if mutual cooperation has been consistent throughout the
# game, continue cooperating to maximize the final payoffs.  7. **Adapt to
# opponent behavior:**    - If the opponent consistently defects without
# returning to cooperation, switch to permanent defection (D) after 5 rounds of
# repeated defection to avoid being exploited.  This revised strategy addresses
# the potential pitfalls of mutual defection, exploitation, and the endgame
# problem while maintaining a cooperative approach when possible.

# cooperation after defection. This prevents predictable exploitation.  This
# revised strategy balances punishment and forgiveness, avoids long defection
# loops, and adapts to different opponent behaviors while maximizing the

# retaliation.  3. **Conditional Forgiveness**: If your opponent defects (plays
# D) once, forgive them by playing C in the next round, but only if they
# cooperated in at least 3 of the last 5 rounds. This encourages cooperation
# while preventing exploitation by frequent defectors.  4. **Punish Consistent
# Defection**: If your opponent defects in two consecutive rounds, switch to
# permanent defection (D) until they cooperate again. This prevents being
# exploited by an opponent who consistently defects.  5. **Endgame
# Consideration**: In the last 10 rounds, switch to defection (D) if your
# opponent has defected more than 30% of the time up to that point. This
# prevents late-game exploitation when the opponent may try to maximize their
# own payoff by defecting.  ### Summary: - Start by cooperating. - Mirror your
# opponentâ€™s previous move. - Forgive a single defection if the opponent has
# shown a pattern of cooperation. - Punish consistent defection by defecting
# until cooperation is restored. - Defect in the final rounds if the opponent
# has a history of frequent defection.

# Plays C:** If the opponent plays C, continue defecting (D) to maximize your
# payoff (5 for you, 0 for them). This exploits cooperative opponents early on.
# 3. **Punish Defection with Defection (D):** If the opponent defects (D),
# respond with defection (D) to avoid being exploited. Continue defecting as
# long as the opponent defects to ensure you donâ€™t fall behind in points.  4.
# **Probe for Cooperation After Mutual Defection:** After 3 consecutive rounds
# of mutual defection (both playing D), switch to cooperation (C) for one round
# to test if the opponent is willing to cooperate. If the opponent responds with
# C, continue cooperating (C) to maximize mutual payoffs (3 each round).  5.
# **Return to Defection (D) if the Opponent Defects After Cooperation:** If the
# opponent defects (D) after youâ€™ve established cooperation, immediately return

# Opponent Alternates:** If the opponent alternates between defection and
# cooperation, mirror their behavior by alternating as well. This prevents them
# from gaining an advantage while maintaining the possibility of cooperation.
# 7. **In the Final 5 Rounds, Always Defect (D):** In the last 5 rounds, always
# defect (D) to maximize your payoff, as future retaliation becomes irrelevant.
# This revised strategy maintains an aggressive approach but introduces
# mechanisms to test for cooperation, punish defection effectively, and avoid
# prolonged mutual defection. It also reduces predictability by shortening the

# previous round, both you and your opponent played C, play C again.  3.

# any round, respond by playing D (defect) in the next round. If the opponent
# continues to defect, escalate by continuing to defect until they return to
# cooperation.  4. **Forgive after opponent returns to cooperation**: If your
# opponent plays C after defecting, return to cooperation (C) in the next round.
# However, if the opponent defects again soon after, escalate the punishment by
# defecting for two consecutive rounds before returning to cooperation.  5.
# **Escalate further for repeated defections**: If the opponent defects multiple
# times in a short period (e.g., within 5 rounds), increase the punishment
# duration by defecting for an additional round each time they defect again
# (e.g., defect for 2 rounds, then 3 rounds, etc.).  6. **Reset after sustained
# cooperation**: If both players cooperate for 10 consecutive rounds, reset the
# punishment escalation, treating the opponent as if they are fully cooperative
# again.  This revised strategy introduces escalating punishment for repeated
# defections, discourages exploitation, and provides a mechanism to reset after
# sustained cooperation, balancing cooperation and deterrence.

# round).  3. **Cooperate if Opponent Cooperates**: Once you switch to
# cooperation, continue cooperating as long as your opponent also cooperates.
# This helps establish a mutually beneficial relationship (3 points per round
# for both).  4. **Punish Defection with Temporary Defection**: If your opponent
# defects while you are cooperating, respond by defecting for **two rounds**.
# This punishes the defection but leaves room for the opponent to return to
# cooperation. After two rounds of defection, return to cooperation if the
# opponent also cooperates.  5. **Occasional Defection to Test Opponentâ€™s
# Commitment**: After a stable period of cooperation (at least 10 consecutive
# rounds of mutual cooperation), defect **once** to test your opponentâ€™s
# willingness to continue cooperating. If they respond with cooperation, return
# to cooperation immediately. If they defect, punish with two rounds of
# defection, then attempt to re-establish cooperation.  6. **Endgame Strategy**:
# In the final 10 rounds, defect in **every other round** (starting with
# defection) to maximize your payoff while still leaving some room for
# cooperation. This prevents the opponent from fully anticipating a complete
# defection strategy and may allow for some cooperative rounds.  ### Summary of
# Key Conditions: - Start with defection and continue until the opponent defects
# twice in a row. - Cooperate if the opponent cooperates, but punish defection
# with two rounds of defection. - Occasionally test cooperation with a single
# defection after a long period of mutual cooperation. - In the final 10 rounds,
# defect every other round to balance maximizing payoff and maintaining some
# cooperation.  This revised strategy balances aggression with opportunities for
# cooperation, while also addressing the need to recover from mutual defection
# and avoid overly predictable behavior.

# ### Revised Strategy: **Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Forgiveness**
# 1. **Start with Cooperation (C)**: In the first round, play C to signal a
# willingness to cooperate.  2. **Mirror the Opponent's Last Move**: From the
# second round onward, play the same move your opponent made in the previous
# round:    - If they played C, you play C.    - If they played D, you play D.
# 3. **Conditional Forgiveness**: If the opponent defects (plays D) but has
# cooperated in at least 70% of the previous 10 rounds, forgive them by playing
# C in the next round. This encourages cooperation while preventing exploitation
# by frequent defectors.  4. **Punish Persistent Defection**: If the opponent
# defects in 3 consecutive rounds, continue playing D until they cooperate
# again. This ensures that persistent defectors are punished more severely.  5.
# **Endgame Caution**: In the last 3 rounds (rounds 998, 999, and 1000),
# continue to mirror the opponentâ€™s last move rather than automatically playing
# C. This prevents exploitation in the final rounds while still allowing for
# cooperation if the opponent remains cooperative.  This revised strategy
# addresses the critiques by making forgiveness conditional on the opponent's
# overall behavior, punishing persistent defectors more effectively, and
# avoiding vulnerability in the endgame.

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for the Iterated Game  1. **Start with
# Defection (D) in the first round.**    - This maintains an aggressive stance
# initially, but leaves room for adaptation.  2. **In the next 3 rounds, mirror
# the opponent's previous move.**    - If they play C, respond with C in the
# next round. If they play D, respond with D. This allows you to test the
# opponent's willingness to cooperate without committing too early.  3. **If the
# opponent cooperates (C) for 3 out of the first 4 rounds, switch to cooperation
# (C) in the 5th round.**    - This opens the door to mutual cooperation
# earlier, maximizing potential payoffs.  4. **If the opponent defects (D) more
# than once in the first 4 rounds, continue defecting (D) until they show
# consistent cooperation (C) for 3 consecutive rounds.**    - This ensures you
# are not exploited while still allowing for a shift to cooperation if the
# opponent changes their behavior.  5. **If the opponent defects (D) after you
# switch to cooperation (C), return to defection (D) for 2 rounds, then test
# cooperation (C) again.**    - This punishes defection but allows for recovery
# from potential mistakes or exploratory defections by the opponent.  6. **If
# the opponent continues to defect (D) after the 2-round punishment, maintain
# defection (D) for the remainder of the game.**    - This prevents further
# exploitation if the opponent is consistently uncooperative.  7. **If the
# opponent consistently cooperates (C) after the 2-round punishment, return to
# cooperation (C) and maintain it as long as they do.**    - This maximizes the
# mutual payoff while allowing for forgiveness and recovery from occasional
# defections.  This revised strategy balances aggression with flexibility,
# allowing for early cooperation if the opponent shows willingness, while still
# punishing defection and preventing exploitation. It also accounts for
# potential mistakes or exploratory defections by the opponent, offering
# opportunities for recovery.

# continues to defect after you start playing D, keep playing D until they
# return to cooperation (play C). This ensures that persistent defection is met
# with sustained punishment.  5. **Forgive after opponent returns to
# cooperation**: If your opponent plays C after a period of defection, return to
# playing C in the next round. This allows cooperation to resume but only after
# the opponent demonstrates a willingness to cooperate.  6. **Monitor for
# alternating defection patterns**: If your opponent alternates between

# opponents who try to take advantage of alternating strategies.  This revised

# ### Revised Neutral Strategy for Iterated Game (1000 Rounds)  1. **Start with
# Cooperation (C)**: In the first round, play C to signal a willingness to
# cooperate, but be prepared to adjust based on the opponent's response.  2.
# **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness**: From the second round onwards, mirror the
# opponent's last move. If they play C, you play C. If they play D, you play D.
# However, if the opponent defects (plays D) once, forgive them by playing C in
# the next round to test if they return to cooperation.  3. **Forgiveness
# Window**: If the opponent returns to cooperation (C) within 1 round after
# defecting, continue cooperating (C). If they defect again immediately after
# your forgiveness, switch to defection (D) until they show consistent
# cooperation for at least 2 consecutive rounds.  4. **Respond to Persistent
# Defection**: If the opponent defects (plays D) for 4 or more consecutive
# rounds, switch to defection (D) for the remainder of the game, as they are
# likely committed to exploiting you.  5. **Endgame Defection Adjustment**: In
# the final 3 rounds, defect (D) regardless of the opponent's actions, as
# cooperation is less likely to be reciprocated in the very last rounds. This
# minimizes the risk of being exploited at the end while still allowing for
# cooperation in most of the game.  This revised strategy balances cooperation,
# forgiveness, and defection more flexibly, while also adjusting the endgame
# defection timing to avoid premature loss of cooperative payoffs.

# plays C, continue playing C.**      - Maintain cooperation as long as the
# opponent cooperates, ensuring both players consistently score 3 points per
# round.  3. **If your opponent plays D (defects), immediately switch to D in
# the next round.**      - Punish defection swiftly to prevent exploitation, but
# do not overcommit to defection.  4. **After one round of mutual defection
# (both playing D), switch back to C to test for cooperation.**      - This
# allows for recovery from misunderstandings or occasional defections, giving
# the opponent a chance to return to cooperation.  5. **If the opponent responds
# to your cooperative test with C, continue playing C.**      - Reward their
# return to cooperation by re-establishing mutual cooperation.  6. **If the
# opponent defects again after your cooperative test (i.e., you play C and they
# play D), switch to D and continue defecting for the next 3 rounds.**      -
# This escalates the punishment for repeated defection, signaling that continued
# betrayal will not be tolerated.  7. **After 3 rounds of mutual defection, test
# cooperation again by playing C.**      - This gives the opponent another
# opportunity to return to cooperation, but with a stronger deterrent against
# further defection.  8. **If the opponent continues to defect after multiple
# cooperative tests, defect for the remainder of the game.**      - At this
# point, the opponent has shown they are not willing to cooperate, so maximize
# your score by defecting consistently.  9. **In the final 10 rounds, defect
# only if the opponent has defected in the previous round.**      - Avoid
# predictable defection in the final rounds to prevent the opponent from
# exploiting you early. If they continue cooperating, maintain cooperation to
# maximize mutual payoffs.  This revised strategy balances an initial
# cooperative approach with a measured response to defection, allowing for
# recovery from occasional betrayals while punishing consistent defection. It

# of their move.  4. **Forgiveness Mechanism**: After punishing with one round
# of defection, return to cooperation (play C) immediately, even if the opponent
# continues to defect. This gives the opponent a chance to re-establish
# cooperation.  5. **Adaptation to Consistent Defection**: If your opponent
# defects for **five consecutive rounds**, switch to always defecting (play D)

# **Occasional Cooperation Test**: If you have switched to always defecting due
# to consistent defection by the opponent, test their willingness to cooperate
# by playing C once every 50 rounds. If they respond with C, return to the Tit-
# for-Tat strategy.  ---  This revised strategy balances cooperation and
# punishment, introduces a forgiveness mechanism, and adapts to consistently
# uncooperative opponents while still allowing for the possibility of re-
# establishing cooperation.

# Defection**:      - If your opponent defects once (i.e., plays **D** while you
# played **C**), forgive them by playing **C** in the next round. This
# encourages them to return to cooperation. However, only forgive once in a row.
# 4. **Punish Persistent Defection**:      - If your opponent defects two times
# in a row (i.e., plays **D** in two consecutive rounds), switch to **D** and
# continue defecting until they return to cooperation. This prevents
# exploitation by persistent defectors.  5. **Return to Cooperation After Mutual
# Defection**:      - If both you and your opponent have played **D** in the
# last round, return to **C** in the next round to give them a chance to
# cooperate again. However, if they defect again after this, follow the
# punishment rule (step 4).  6. **Never Defect First**:      - Always maintain
# cooperation unless your opponent defects first. This ensures you are not the
# one initiating conflict.  This revised strategy balances cooperation with a
# more robust response to persistent defection, reducing the risk of
# exploitation while still allowing for recovery of cooperation after occasional
# defections.

# inconsistent behavior.  3. **Punish Persistent Defection More Aggressively:**
# If your opponent defects for two consecutive rounds, switch to playing D for
# **three consecutive rounds** to punish persistent defection. This increases
# the cost of defection for the opponent and discourages repeated exploitation.
# 4. **Adapt to Opponent Behavior:** If the opponent alternates between
# cooperation and defection frequently (e.g., every other round), switch to
# playing D consistently until they demonstrate a clear pattern of cooperation
# for at least three consecutive rounds. This prevents the opponent from
# exploiting predictable tit-for-tat behavior.  5. **Final 20 Rounds - Shift to
# Defection Earlier:** In the last 20 rounds, begin to defect more frequently.
# Start by defecting every third round, then gradually increase the frequency of
# defection as the game approaches the final 10 rounds. In the last 5 rounds,
# defect consistently to maximize your payoff, as cooperation becomes less
# valuable near the end.  6. **Adjust for Random or Irrational Opponents:** If
# the opponentâ€™s behavior appears random or irrational (e.g., no discernible
# pattern of cooperation or defection), switch to playing D consistently after
# the first 10 rounds to avoid being exploited by unpredictable behavior.  This
# revised strategy incorporates stricter forgiveness, more aggressive punishment
# for persistent defection, and an earlier shift to defection in the final
# rounds, while also accounting for the possibility of facing random or
# irrational opponents.

# ### Revised Strategy: Opportunistic Cooperation with Punishment  1. **First
# move: Cooperate (C)**      Start by cooperating to signal a willingness to
# establish mutual cooperation, which yields the highest long-term payoff (3
# points per round).  2. **If your opponent cooperates (C): Continue cooperating
# (C)**      If your opponent also cooperates, continue cooperating in every
# round to maximize mutual payoffs (3 points each round). Do not defect unless
# the opponent defects first.  3. **If your opponent defects (D): Defect (D) in
# the next round**      If your opponent defects, immediately retaliate by
# defecting in the next round. This discourages further defection by showing
# that you will not tolerate exploitation.  4. **After retaliating with
# defection: Return to cooperation (C) if the opponent cooperates**      After
# one round of defection, if your opponent returns to cooperation, immediately
# switch back to cooperation. This signals that you are willing to forgive and
# re-establish mutual cooperation.  5. **If the opponent continues to defect
# (D): Defect (D) until they cooperate**      If the opponent continues to
# defect after your initial retaliation, keep defecting until they switch back
# to cooperation. This ensures that you are not exploited while also giving the
# opponent a chance to return to cooperation.  6. **Endgame (last 3 rounds):
# Defect (D)**      In the final 3 rounds, always defect regardless of the
# opponentâ€™s actions. Since the game is finite, defection in the last few rounds
# maximizes your points without risking long-term retaliation.  ### Summary: -
# Start with cooperation to establish trust and maximize mutual payoffs. -
# Retaliate immediately after defection but return to cooperation if the
# opponent does. - Punish persistent defection with continued defection until
# the opponent cooperates again. - Defect in the final 3 rounds to secure
# maximum points at the end of the game.

# ### Revised Cooperative Strategy for Maximising Overall Payoff  1. **Start by
# cooperating**: On the first round, play **C (Cooperate)**.  2. **Continue
# cooperating if both players cooperate**: As long as both you and your opponent
# play **C** in the previous round, continue to play **C** in the next round.
# 3. **Punish defection with a temporary response**: If your opponent plays **D
# (Defect)** while you played **C**, switch to **D** for the next **two rounds**
# to punish the defection. This provides a clear but limited consequence for
# defection.  4. **Return to cooperation after punishment**: After the two-round
# punishment, return to **C** regardless of your opponentâ€™s actions, signaling a
# willingness to restore cooperation. This prevents prolonged mutual defection
# cycles.  5. **Test for opponent's cooperation after defection**: If your
# opponent continues to defect after the punishment period, play **C** once more
# to test if they are willing to return to cooperation. If they cooperate,
# continue cooperating. If they defect again, switch to **D** for another two
# rounds.  6. **Endgame strategy with gradual defection**: In the final 10
# rounds, begin to defect **gradually**. Start by defecting every other round
# (alternating between **C** and **D**), and in the final 3 rounds, defect
# consistently. This reduces the risk of early defection by the opponent while
# still maximising short-term payoffs.  ---  This revised strategy incorporates
# a more measured punishment, forgiveness, and testing mechanism, while also
# addressing the endgame defection issue by introducing a gradual shift to
# defection rather than an abrupt switch.

# keep playing C to maintain mutual cooperation.  3. **Defect (D) if the
# opponent defects, but only for two rounds.**      If the opponent plays D,
# retaliate by playing D for the next two rounds. This ensures punishment but
# avoids getting stuck in a cycle of mutual defection.  4. **After two rounds of
# defection, test for cooperation by playing C.**      After punishing the
# opponent with two rounds of D, return to C to test if the opponent is willing
# to cooperate again.  5. **If the opponent defects again after your test,
# switch to permanent defection.**      If the opponent defects after you return
# to C, assume they are not interested in cooperation and switch to playing D
# for the rest of the game.  6. **If mutual cooperation is restored, continue
# cooperating.**      If the opponent responds to your test by playing C,
# continue cooperating as long as they do.  This revised strategy introduces a
# limited punishment period, a test for cooperation after defection, and a
# mechanism to permanently defect if the opponent consistently defects,

# ### Revised Strategy for 1000-Round Iterated Game  1. **Initial Play (Round
# 1):**      Start by playing **C** (Cooperate) to test your opponent's
# willingness to cooperate.  2. **Tit-for-Tat with Occasional Defection (Rounds
# 2â€“990):**      - **If your opponent played C in the previous round**:
# Play **C** to encourage mutual cooperation and maximize long-term payoffs (3
# points each round).        - **If your opponent played D in the previous
# round**:        Play **D** in the next round to punish defection and prevent
# exploitation. However, after one round of mutual defection, return to **C** to
# test if the opponent is willing to cooperate again.  3. **Occasional Defection
# (Rounds 2â€“990):**      Every 50 rounds, regardless of the opponent's behavior,
# play **D** once to test if the opponent is overly trusting and can be
# exploited for a higher payoff. If the opponent retaliates with D, return to
# cooperation in the next round.  4. **Endgame (Final 10 Rounds):**      In the
# last 10 rounds, gradually shift to more defection:    - **Rounds 991â€“995**:
# Play **C** if the opponent has been cooperative, but defect once or twice to
# test their response.    - **Rounds 996â€“1000**: Play **D** consistently to
# secure points and avoid being exploited in the final rounds.  ### Rationale
# This revised strategy balances cooperation and defection, allowing for long-
# term cooperation when possible while still testing the opponent's trust
# periodically. It includes a mechanism to recover from mutual defection and
# adapts to different opponent behaviors. The endgame shift to defection secures
# points while minimizing the risk of late-game exploitation.

# **Revised Strategy:**  1. **Start with cooperation**: In the first round, play

# subsequent round, mimic your opponent's previous move (i.e., if they played C
# in the previous round, you play C; if they played D, you play D).  3.
# **Forgive isolated defections**:    - If your opponent defects (plays D) but
# has cooperated in 4 of the last 5 rounds, return to cooperation (play C) in
# the next round, assuming the defection was an isolated mistake.  4. **Punish
# consistent defections quickly**:    - If your opponent defects for 2
# consecutive rounds, switch to playing D (defect) in the next round to signal
# that consistent defection will not be tolerated.  5. **Escalate punishment for
# persistent defectors**:    - If your opponent continues to defect for 3 or
# more consecutive rounds, continue defecting (play D) until they cooperate for
# 3 consecutive rounds. This ensures that persistent defectors face a strong
# response.  6. **Return to cooperation after sustained cooperation**:    - If
# your opponent cooperates for 3 consecutive rounds after a period of defection,
# return to cooperation (play C) in the next round to re-establish a cooperative
# relationship.  7. **Handle long-term defectors**:    - If your opponent
# defects for more than 10 consecutive rounds, assume they are a persistent
# defector and continue defecting for the remainder of the game to avoid being
# exploited.  This revised strategy addresses the previous critiques by
# clarifying forgiveness conditions, responding more quickly to defections, and
# providing a clear mechanism for handling persistent defectors.

# subsequent round, play what your opponent played in the previous round (Tit-
# for-Tat).    - If your opponent defects, respond with defection (D) in the
# next round.    - **Forgive after a single defection**: If your opponent
# cooperates after defecting once, return to cooperation (C) immediately. This
# prevents long cycles of mutual defection and encourages cooperation.  3.
# **Punish Persistent Defection:**    - If your opponent defects **three times
# in a row**, switch to defection (D) and continue defecting until they
# cooperate again. This punishes consistent defection while allowing for
# recovery if the opponent changes behavior.  4. **Adapt to Opponentâ€™s
# Strategy:**    - If your opponent consistently cooperates for **10 consecutive
# rounds**, switch to always cooperating (C) to maximize mutual payoffs.    - If
# your opponent consistently defects for **10 consecutive rounds**, switch to
# always defecting (D) to avoid being exploited.  5. **Endgame Strategy (Rounds
# 990-1000):**    - In rounds 990-995, continue playing Tit-for-Tat to maintain
# cooperation if possible.    - In rounds 996-1000, defect (D) regardless of
# prior history, as there is no future retaliation to worry about.  This revised
# strategy balances cooperation, retaliation, and forgiveness more effectively,
# while adapting to the opponentâ€™s behavior and avoiding predictable

# be tolerated.  4. **Forgive occasional defections**:    - If the opponent
# defects once after a long period of cooperation, **return to cooperation (C)**
# in the next round to test if the defection was a one-time event. This prevents
# unnecessary cycles of mutual defection and allows for the possibility of re-
# establishing cooperation.  5. **Endgame strategy (final 100 rounds)**:    -
# **Continue cooperating (C)** if mutual cooperation is still in place. Avoid
# predictable defection in the final rounds, as this could lead the opponent to
# defect early, reducing overall payoffs.    - **Switch to defection (D)** only
# in the final 10 rounds (rounds 990â€“1000) if the opponent has shown a tendency
# to defect in the past. This allows you to exploit the endgame without
# prematurely triggering defection from the opponent.  6. **Adapt to the
# opponentâ€™s behavior**:    - If the opponent consistently defects (D)
# regardless of your actions, **defect (D) in every round** to minimize losses
# (1 point per round).    - If the opponent consistently cooperates (C),
# **continue cooperating (C)** to maximize mutual payoffs.  ### Summary: - Start
# with defection but quickly switch to cooperation if the opponent shows
# willingness to cooperate. - Punish defection but allow for forgiveness to
# avoid unnecessary cycles of mutual defection. - Maintain cooperation as long
# as possible, especially in the endgame, unless the opponent has a history of
# defection. - Adapt to the opponentâ€™s behavior to maximize overall payoffs.

# round:    - **If the opponent responds with C**, return to mutual cooperation.
# - **If the opponent responds with D**, revert to playing D for the remainder

# Testing: Defect Once Every 100 Rounds**      To test whether your opponent is
# overly cooperative or trying to exploit you, defect (play **D**) once every
# 100 rounds (i.e., in rounds 100, 200, 300, etc.).      This reduces
# predictability and helps gauge whether your opponent will retaliate or
# continue cooperating.  4. **Forgiveness Mechanism: Return to Cooperation After
# Mutual Defection**      If both you and your opponent defect in the same
# round, return to cooperation (play **C**) in the next round to avoid a
# prolonged cycle of defection.  5. **Endgame: Defect in the Final 2 Rounds**
# In rounds 999 and 1000, always defect (play **D**) to maximize your payoff at
# the end of the game, when cooperation is no longer beneficial.  ### Summary -
# Start by cooperating. - Mirror your opponentâ€™s last move unless itâ€™s a
# multiple of 100, at which point you defect to test their behavior. - If both

# payoffs.  2. **Defect if Opponent Defects:**      - If the opponent plays D in
# any round, immediately switch to D in the next round to prevent exploitation.
# This signals that defection will be met with defection.  3. **Return to
# Cooperation After One Round of Mutual Defection:**      - If both you and the
# opponent defect in the same round, switch back to C in the next round to test
# if the opponent is willing to cooperate again. This introduces a mechanism for
# forgiveness and avoids getting stuck in a cycle of mutual defection.  4.
# **Punish Consistent Defection:**      - If the opponent defects for **two
# consecutive rounds** after you have returned to cooperation, switch to
# permanent defection (D) for the remainder of the game. This prevents ongoing
# exploitation and ensures you avoid repeated 0-point outcomes.  5. **Alternate
# Defection and Cooperation Only if Opponent Does So First:**      - If the
# opponent alternates between C and D, mirror their behavior by alternating your
# own moves between D and C. This ensures you maintain a balance between
# exploiting their cooperation and avoiding being exploited yourself.  6.
# **Gradually Shift to Defection in the Final 50 Rounds:**      - Starting from
# Round 950, defect every **third round** (e.g., D, C, C, D, C, C, etc.). This
# introduces uncertainty for the opponent and allows you to gain some extra
# points without fully abandoning cooperation too early.      - In the final
# **10 rounds**, defect continuously to maximize your points as the game nears
# its end and cooperation becomes less valuable.  This revised strategy balances
# aggression with opportunities for cooperation, incorporates forgiveness to
# avoid prolonged mutual defection, and introduces a gradual shift to defection
# in the final rounds to maximize late-game payoffs without being too
# predictable.

# onward, **mimic** your opponentâ€™s previous move. If they played C, you play C.
# If they played D, you play D.    - **Forgiveness Rule**: If your opponent
# defects (plays D) once, forgive them and play C in the next round. If they
# cooperate after that, continue cooperating (C). If they defect again
# immediately after your forgiveness, switch to playing D until they cooperate
# again.  3. **Revert to Cooperation:** If your opponent switches back to C
# after a series of D moves, return to playing C immediately.  4. **Punish
# Persistent Defection:** If your opponent defects three times in a row without
# cooperating, switch to playing D for five rounds as punishment. After the five
# rounds, return to cooperation (C) to test if they are willing to cooperate
# again.  5. **Adapt to Opponentâ€™s Behavior:** If the opponent continues to

# the remainder of the game. If they start cooperating again, return to the tit-
# for-tat with forgiveness approach.  ---  This revised strategy addresses the

# ### Revised Strategy: "Adaptive Aggression with Conditional Cooperation"  1.
# **Round 1 (Opening Move)**: Play **C**.      Start cooperatively to test the
# opponentâ€™s behavior and avoid provoking immediate retaliation.  2. **Rounds
# 2-5 (Exploration Phase)**:      - If the opponent played **C** in the previous
# round, continue playing **C** to encourage mutual cooperation.    - If the
# opponent played **D** in the previous round, immediately switch to **D** for
# the next round to signal that defection will be punished.    - After punishing
# with **D**, return to **C** to test if the opponent is willing to cooperate
# again.  3. **Rounds 6-20 (Conditional Cooperation Phase)**:      - If the
# opponent consistently plays **C**, continue playing **C** to maximize mutual
# payoffs.    - If the opponent defects more than once during this phase, switch
# to **D** for 2 rounds as a punishment, then return to **C** to test for
# cooperation again.    - If the opponent continues to defect after the 2-round
# punishment, switch to **D** permanently until they show signs of cooperation.
# 4. **Rounds 21-990 (Long-Term Adaptation)**:      - If the opponent has shown
# consistent cooperation (playing **C** for at least 5 consecutive rounds),
# maintain cooperation by playing **C** in every round.    - If the opponent
# defects after a long period of cooperation, respond with **D** for 2 rounds,
# then return to **C** to test if cooperation can be restored.    - If the
# opponent defects repeatedly (more than 3 times in 10 rounds), switch to **D**
# permanently to avoid further exploitation.  5. **Endgame (Last 10 Rounds)**:
# - In the final 10 rounds, continue playing **C** if the opponent has been
# cooperative throughout the game.    - If the opponent has defected recently or
# if you suspect they will defect in the endgame, switch to **D** in the last 3
# rounds to maximize your payoff without risking future retaliation.  ---  ###
# Key Improvements: - **Cooperative Opening**: Starting with **C** avoids
# unnecessary provocation and encourages mutual cooperation from the outset. -
# **Balanced Punishment**: Punishments are shorter (2 rounds) and more measured,
# reducing the risk of escalating conflict while still discouraging defection. -
# **Flexibility**: The strategy adapts to different opponent behaviors, allowing
# for cooperation with cooperative opponents and defection against consistently
# uncooperative ones. - **Endgame Caution**: Defection is reserved for the final
# 3 rounds, reducing predictability and allowing for more cooperation in the
# late game if the opponent remains trustworthy.

# ### Revised Cooperative Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Flexible
# Forgiveness"  1. **Start with Cooperation (C):** In the first round, always
# play C to signal a willingness to cooperate.  2. **Reciprocate the Opponent's
# Previous Move:**    - If your opponent played C in the previous round, play C
# in the current round.    - If your opponent played D in the previous round,
# play D in the current round.  3. **Forgive Occasional Defections Quickly:**
# - If your opponent defects (plays D) once, immediately return to playing C in
# the next round. This allows for mistakes or strategic testing by the opponent
# without triggering a prolonged defection cycle.    - However, if the opponent
# defects again within the next 3 rounds after being forgiven, switch to playing
# D until they return to cooperation (play C).  4. **Punish Consistent Defection
# with Gradual Retaliation:**    - If your opponent defects for 2 or more
# consecutive rounds, play D in response. Continue playing D until they return
# to cooperation (play C).    - Once they play C, return to C in the next round
# to re-establish cooperation, but be more cautious. If they defect again within
# 5 rounds, switch to a more sustained defection (D) for 3 rounds before
# attempting cooperation again.  5. **Adapt to Mixed Strategies:**    - If the
# opponent alternates between C and D unpredictably (e.g., playing D more than
# 30% of the time over any 20-round period), switch to a "Grim Trigger"
# approach: play D for the remainder of the game to avoid being exploited.  6.
# **Endgame Caution (Final 10 Rounds):**    - In the last 10 rounds, continue to
# reciprocate the opponent's moves (C for C, D for D) rather than
# unconditionally cooperating. This prevents exploitation in the final rounds
# while still allowing for cooperation if the opponent remains cooperative.
# This revised strategy addresses the critiques by introducing quicker
# forgiveness, clearer handling of early defections, and a more cautious
# approach to the endgame. It also includes a mechanism to adapt to opponents
# who use mixed or unpredictable strategies.

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for Iterated Normal-Form Game (1000 Rounds)
# 1. **Initial Move**: Start by playing **D** in the first round. This sets an
# aggressive tone and tests your opponent's response.  2. **Response to
# Opponent's Move**:    - **If the opponent plays C**: In the next round, play
# **C** to test for potential cooperation. If the opponent continues to play C,
# maintain mutual cooperation (both playing C) to maximize long-term payoffs (3
# points each).    - **If the opponent plays D**: Continue playing **D**. Mutual
# defection yields 1 point for both, which is better than risking 0 points by
# cooperating while they defect.  3. **Retaliation and Forgiveness**:    - **If
# the opponent defects (plays D) after a period of mutual cooperation**:
# Immediately switch to **D** in the next round to punish the defection.    -
# **After one round of mutual defection**, return to **C** to offer a chance for
# the opponent to re-establish cooperation. If the opponent responds with **C**,
# resume cooperation. If they defect again, continue playing **D** for several
# rounds (e.g., 5 rounds) before testing cooperation again.  4. **Endgame**:
# - In the final 10 rounds, **gradually shift to defection**. Start defecting in
# the last 3 rounds to avoid being exploited at the end, but maintain
# cooperation as long as possible before that to maximize points.  ### Summary:
# - **Start aggressively** with defection but be open to cooperation if the
# opponent signals willingness. - **Punish defection** but offer opportunities
# for the opponent to return to cooperation. - **Adapt to the opponent's
# behavior** by balancing aggression with forgiveness. - **Defect
# strategically** in the final rounds to avoid exploitation.

# **Revised Cooperative Strategy for 1000-Round Iterated Game**  1. **Start by
# Cooperating**: In the first round, play C (Cooperate).  2. **Tit-for-Tat with
# Leniency**: From the second round onward, generally repeat your opponentâ€™s
# previous move:    - If your opponent played C in the previous round, play C.
# - If your opponent played D in the previous round, play C once to test if it
# was a one-time defection. If they cooperate in the next round, continue
# cooperating. If they defect again, switch to defection.  3. **Forgive
# Occasional Defections**: If your opponent defects (plays D) but then returns
# to cooperation (plays C in the next round), forgive them by playing C again.
# This allows for occasional mistakes or tests without falling into a defection
# cycle.  4. **Monitor for Consistent Defection**: If the opponent defects for
# two consecutive rounds, assume they are committed to defection. In this case,
# switch to defection (D) and continue defecting until they show a clear pattern
# of cooperation (at least two consecutive C moves).  5. **Endgame
# Consideration**: In the final 10 rounds, defect (play D) regardless of the
# opponentâ€™s actions. This prevents exploitation in the endgame when there is no
# future retaliation.  6. **Adapt to Opponentâ€™s Strategy**: If the opponent
# shows a clear pattern of cooperation over many rounds (e.g., 10 consecutive C
# moves), continue cooperating even after a single defection, as this may
# indicate a cooperative strategy with occasional noise. Conversely, if the
# opponent frequently alternates between C and D, be more cautious and defect
# more readily.  This revised strategy balances cooperation with protection
# against exploitation, while also considering the finite nature of the game and
# the need for flexibility in response to the opponentâ€™s behavior.

# round onwards, repeat your opponentâ€™s previous move, but apply the following
# adjustments:     a. **If your opponent defects (plays D) once, defect (play D)
# in the next round.**          b. **If your opponent defects twice
# consecutively, defect in the next round, but return to cooperation (play C) if
# they cooperate in the following round.**          c. **If your opponent
# defects three or more times consecutively, continue defecting (play D) until
# they cooperate for two consecutive rounds. Once they cooperate twice in a row,
# return to cooperation (play C).**  3. **Handle alternating behavior**:      If
# your opponent alternates between cooperation and defection (e.g., CDCD
# pattern), switch to defecting (play D) consistently until they cooperate for
# two consecutive rounds. Then, return to cooperation (play C).  4. **Occasional
# forgiveness**:      Every 50 rounds, even if your opponent is consistently
# defecting, play C once to test if they will switch to cooperation. If they
# cooperate in response, resume cooperation (play C) in subsequent rounds. If
# they defect, return to defecting (play D) until the next forgiveness test.  5.
# **Endgame caution**:      In the last 50 rounds, be more cautious about
# cooperation. If your opponent has defected more than 50% of the time
# throughout the game, defect (play D) consistently in the final 10 rounds to
# avoid late-game exploitation. If they have cooperated more than 50% of the
# time, continue with the Tit-for-Tat approach.  6. **Adapt to random or
# unpredictable behavior**:      If your opponentâ€™s behavior appears random or
# unpredictable (e.g., no clear pattern of cooperation or defection), switch to
# a probabilistic approach:      - Cooperate (play C) with a 70% probability and
# defect (play D) with a 30% probability.      - Reassess every 100 rounds to
# determine if a clearer pattern has emerged, and adjust back to Tit-for-Tat if
# necessary.  This revised strategy incorporates more frequent forgiveness,
# handles alternating behavior, and introduces caution in the endgame while
# adapting to random opponents.

# After the first round, adopt a tit-for-tat approach:    - If the opponent
# cooperates (C), continue cooperating (C) in the next round.    - If the
# opponent defects (D), defect (D) in the next round to punish them.  3.
# **Forgive After One Defection**: If the opponent defects only once and then
# returns to cooperation (C) in the following round, forgive them by returning
# to cooperation (C) as well. This prevents getting stuck in a cycle of mutual
# defection.  4. **Escalate Punishment for Repeated Defection**: If the opponent
# defects twice in a row, escalate the punishment by defecting (D) for the next
# three rounds. After this, return to tit-for-tat behavior, but remain cautious.
# 5. **Re-evaluate After 100 Rounds**: After 100 rounds, assess the opponentâ€™s
# behavior:    - If the opponent has been mostly cooperative, continue with tit-
# for-tat.    - If the opponent has been mostly defecting, switch to consistent
# defection (D) to avoid further exploitation.  6. **Final 50 Rounds Strategy**:

# (D) in the final 10 rounds regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions to secure
# higher individual payoffs.    - Before the final 10 rounds, continue tit-for-
# tat but be more inclined to defect if the opponent shows any signs of
# defection.  This revised strategy balances cooperation and punishment, adapts
# to the opponentâ€™s behavior, and avoids getting stuck in mutual defection while
# still securing higher payoffs in the final rounds.

# **Revised Strategy: "Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Randomized Forgiveness"**  1.
# **Start by cooperating (play C) in the first round.**     2. **For each
# subsequent round, follow these rules:**    - If your opponent cooperated
# (played C) in the previous round, continue cooperating (play C).    - If your
# opponent defected (played D) in the previous round, retaliate by defecting
# (play D) in the next round.     3. **Introduce a small, random chance of
# forgiveness after a defection**: After retaliating once for a defection, in
# subsequent rounds, cooperate (play C) with a 10-20% probability, even if the
# opponent continues to defect. This prevents the opponent from predicting when
# you will forgive and encourages them to return to cooperation.  4. **Monitor
# patterns of defection**: If the opponent defects consistently for more than 3
# consecutive rounds, switch to permanent defection (play D) to avoid being
# exploited.  5. **In the final 5 rounds, defect (play D) only if the opponent
# has defected in the previous round**: This allows you to maintain cooperation
# as long as possible while still protecting against late-game exploitation.
# This revised strategy addresses the previous issues by introducing
# unpredictability in forgiveness, avoiding rigid patterns, and allowing for
# more nuanced responses to defections. It also reduces the risk of mutual
# defection in the final rounds while still protecting against exploitation.

# ### Revised Strategy: Conditional Cooperation with Escalating Retaliation  1.
# **Start with Cooperation (C):** In the first round, play C (cooperate) to
# establish mutual trust and signal a willingness to collaborate.  2. **Continue
# Cooperation if Reciprocated:** If your opponent also plays C in the previous
# round, continue playing C. This maximizes collective payoffs when both players
# are cooperating.  3. **Defect (D) if Betrayed:** If your opponent plays D
# (defects) in any round, retaliate by playing D in the next round. This
# discourages exploitation by ensuring that defection is punished.  4.
# **Escalate Retaliation for Consecutive Defections:** If your opponent defects
# again after your retaliation (i.e., they defect two or more times in a row),
# continue playing D for an increasing number of rounds. For each additional
# consecutive defection by the opponent, extend your retaliation by one more
# round (e.g., defect for two rounds after two consecutive defections, three
# rounds after three consecutive defections, etc.). This escalates the
# punishment for persistent betrayal.  5. **Return to Cooperation After
# Retaliation Ends:** Once the opponent returns to cooperation (C), reset the
# retaliation cycle and return to playing C in the next round. This signals a
# willingness to forgive and re-establish cooperation, but only after the
# opponent has shown a willingness to cooperate again.  6. **Maintain
# Cooperation if Opponent Stops Defecting:** If the opponent stops defecting and
# plays C consistently, continue playing C to maximize mutual payoffs.  This
# revised strategy addresses the previous issues by introducing escalating
# retaliation for repeated defections, making it harder for the opponent to
# exploit the strategy while still allowing for forgiveness and the possibility
# of returning to cooperation.

# - Instead of forgiving on a fixed schedule, forgive (play C) after every 5
# consecutive rounds of mutual defection (D vs. D) to test if the opponent is
# willing to return to cooperation.  4. **Endgame caution:**    - In the final

# **Revised Aggressive Strategy for Iterated Normal-Form Game:**  1. **Start by
# playing D (Defect).**      Begin the game aggressively to avoid being
# exploited early and to test the opponent's response.  2. **Continue playing D
# as long as the opponent plays C (Cooperate).**      Maximise your score by
# defecting while the opponent cooperates, taking advantage of their
# cooperation.  3. **If the opponent plays D, continue playing D for the next 3
# rounds.**      Punish the opponent for defecting by defecting for multiple
# rounds to discourage further defection. This ensures you maintain an
# aggressive stance and avoid being exploited.  4. **After 3 rounds of mutual
# defection, switch to C (Cooperate) to test for a cooperative response.**
# After punishing the opponent, offer a chance to return to mutual cooperation.
# This balances aggression with the potential for higher long-term payoffs
# through cooperation.  5. **If the opponent responds with C, continue playing
# C.**      If the opponent reciprocates your cooperative gesture, maintain
# cooperation to benefit from the mutual score of 3.  6. **If the opponent
# defects again after your C, return to D and defect for the remainder of the
# game.**      If the opponent defects after you attempt cooperation, switch
# back to defection and stay there permanently to avoid further exploitation.
# 7. **In the final 20 rounds, always play D regardless of the opponentâ€™s
# actions.**      In the last 20 rounds, defect consistently to secure higher
# payoffs, as the game is nearing its end and the risk of retaliation is
# minimal.  This revised strategy maintains an aggressive approach while
# incorporating a more structured punishment and testing mechanism, reducing the
# risk of exploitation and adapting to the opponent's behavior.

# cooperating (C) in the first round.**  - **On each subsequent round:**   - If
# your opponent cooperated (C) in the previous round, continue cooperating (C).
# - If your opponent defected (D) in the previous round, defect (D) in the next
# round as punishment.  - **Forgiveness mechanism**:   - If your opponent
# cooperates (C) after a defection, return to cooperation (C) immediately to
# encourage mutual cooperation.    - **Gradual retaliation for repeated
# defections**:   - If your opponent defects (D) for **two consecutive rounds**,
# defect (D) for **two rounds** in response.   - If your opponent defects (D)
# for **three consecutive rounds**, defect (D) for **three rounds** in response.
# - Continue increasing the length of your defections by one round for each
# additional consecutive defection by your opponent (e.g., four defections lead
# to four rounds of defection, and so on).  - **Permanent defection threshold**:
# - If your opponent defects (D) for **five consecutive rounds**, switch to
# permanent defection (D) for the rest of the game to avoid continuous
# exploitation.  ### Summary: - Begin by cooperating. - Punish defection with a
# single round of defection, but escalate the punishment if defections continue.
# - Forgive and return to cooperation if the opponent cooperates after a
# defection. - Switch to permanent defection if the opponent defects for five
# consecutive rounds.

# ### Revised Strategy: **Adaptive Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Forgiveness**
# 1. **Start by Cooperating**: In the first round, always play C (Cooperate) to
# signal a willingness to establish mutual cooperation.  2. **Mirror the
# Opponent's Last Move**: From the second round onward, copy your opponent's
# previous move. If they cooperated in the last round, you cooperate (play C).
# If they defected in the last round, you defect (play D).  3. **Forgive After a
# Single Defection**: If the opponent defects once, forgive them by playing C in
# the next round. This allows for occasional mistakes or random defections
# without immediately escalating into a cycle of mutual defection.  4. **Punish
# Persistent Defection**: If the opponent defects for 3 consecutive rounds,
# switch to defection (play D) until they cooperate again. This prevents
# exploitation by opponents who defect repeatedly.  5. **Return to Cooperation
# After Opponent Cooperates**: If the opponent returns to cooperation after a
# period of defection, immediately switch back to cooperation (play C) to re-
# establish mutual trust.  6. **End-Game Strategy**: In the final 50 rounds,
# gradually become more cautious. If the opponent defects more than twice in
# this period, switch to defection for the remainder of the game to avoid being
# exploited in the end-game phase.  ---  This revised strategy addresses the
# critiques by introducing conditional forgiveness, punishing persistent
# defection, and adapting to the fixed length of the game. It balances
# cooperation with the need to avoid exploitation, while also allowing for
# recovery from occasional mistakes.

# Cooperate (C) after your first Defect (D), continue playing Defect (D) in
# every subsequent round to maximize your payoff (5 points) while they score 0.
# This exploits cooperative opponents.  3. **Switch to Tit-for-Tat if Opponent
# Defects (D):** If your opponent plays Defect (D) in any round, switch to a
# Tit-for-Tat strategy:    - If your opponent plays C, respond with C in the
# next round.    - If your opponent plays D, respond with D in the next round.

# unless your opponent defects again, at which point revert to Tit-for-Tat.
# This revised strategy maintains an aggressive stance by exploiting cooperative

# 1. **Start with Cooperation (C):** Begin the game by playing Cooperation (C)

# yields the highest long-term payoff (3 points each).  2. **Tit-for-Tat with
# Immediate Defection Response:** After the first round, adopt a tit-for-tat
# strategy. If your opponent cooperates, continue cooperating. If your opponent
# defects, immediately defect in the next round to signal that defection will
# not be tolerated.  3. **Forgive After One Defection:** If your opponent
# defects once but returns to cooperation in the following round, forgive them
# and return to cooperation as well. This prevents a prolonged cycle of mutual
# defection and encourages a return to higher payoffs.  4. **Occasional
# Defection to Test Opponentâ€™s Commitment:** Every 20-30 rounds, defect once
# even if your opponent has been cooperating consistently. This tests their
# commitment to cooperation and keeps them from assuming you will always
# cooperate. If they respond with defection, return to cooperation after one
# round of mutual defection.  5. **Adapt to Opponentâ€™s Strategy:** If the
# opponent consistently defects, switch to constant defection (D) to avoid being
# exploited. If they consistently cooperate, continue cooperating to maximize
# mutual payoffs.  6. **Gradual Shift to Defection in the Final 10 Rounds:** In
# the last 10 rounds, begin defecting gradually. Start by defecting once every
# few rounds, then increase the frequency of defection as the game approaches
# the final round. This reduces the risk of the opponent anticipating a sudden
# switch to constant defection and retaliating early.  7. **Final Round
# Defection:** On the very last round, always defect (D), as there is no future
# consequence for doing so, and it maximizes your final payoff.

# ### Revised Strategy: **Tit-for-Tat with Gradual Forgiveness**  1. **Start by
# cooperating.**      Play C in the first round.  2. **Mirror your opponent's
# previous move, but with a delay in retaliation.**      If your opponent plays
# C, continue to play C. If your opponent plays D, respond with D in the next
# round, but only after two consecutive defections. This delay helps avoid
# unnecessary escalation due to a single defection or mistake.  3. **Forgive
# after a single defection.**      If your opponent defects once (plays D) but
# returns to cooperation (plays C) in the next round, immediately return to
# cooperation (play C). This encourages the opponent to return to cooperation
# without punishing them too harshly for a single defection.  4. **Gradually
# escalate punishment for repeated defections.**      If your opponent defects
# for two consecutive rounds, defect once in response. If they continue to
# defect for three or more rounds, defect for an increasing number of rounds
# (e.g., defect for two rounds after three defections, three rounds after four
# defections, etc.). This gradual escalation discourages persistent defection
# while allowing for recovery.  5. **Return to cooperation if the opponent shows
# willingness to cooperate.**      If your opponent returns to cooperation
# (plays C) after a series of defections, return to cooperation (play C) after
# one round of defection. This allows for reconciliation and avoids long-term
# mutual defection.  6. **Account for potential noise or mistakes.**      If
# defections appear sporadic or inconsistent (e.g., alternating between C and
# D), assume the opponent may be making mistakes or using a mixed strategy. In
# this case, continue to cooperate more often than defect, but still mirror
# defection occasionally to avoid being exploited.  This revised strategy
# balances cooperation with a more measured response to defection, allowing for
# recovery from mistakes while discouraging long-term exploitation.

# your opponent played C in the previous round, play C.    - If your opponent
# played D in the previous round, retaliate by playing D in the next round.  3.
# **Controlled Retaliation:**    - If the opponent defects (plays D), retaliate
# by playing D for **one round only**. After that, return to C, regardless of
# the opponentâ€™s next move. This prevents getting stuck in a long defection
# cycle.  4. **Forgiveness Mechanism:**    - If the opponent defects twice in a
# row, play C after your second defection to test for cooperation again. If they
# respond with C, continue cooperating.    - If the opponent defects again after
# you return to C, repeat the controlled retaliation (one round of D) and then
# return to C.  5. **Punish Persistent Defection:**    - If the opponent defects
# **three times in a row**, switch to playing D indefinitely, as they are likely
# committed to defection. This prevents excessive exploitation.  6. **Mistake
# Recovery:**    - If the opponent returns to C after a defection streak,
# immediately return to C as well. This allows for recovery from accidental
# defections and avoids unnecessary punishment.  7. **Endgame Adjustment:**    -
# In the final 10 rounds, if the opponent has been cooperative (mostly playing
# C), continue cooperating.    - If the opponent has been defecting frequently,
# switch to D in the last 5 rounds to avoid being exploited at the end of the
# game.  This revised strategy balances cooperation, controlled retaliation, and
# forgiveness, while also considering the potential for mistakes and the length
# of the game.

# ### Revised Aggressive Strategy for the Iterated Normal-Form Game  1. **Start
# by Cooperating (C)** in the first round to avoid provoking immediate
# retaliation and to test the opponent's willingness to cooperate.  2. **Defect
# (D) if the opponent defects in any round**. Continue defecting until the
# opponent cooperates **twice in a row**.  3. **Return to Cooperation (C) after
# the opponent cooperates twice in a row**. This signals a willingness to
# rebuild trust and potentially achieve higher payoffs through mutual
# cooperation.  4. **Alternate between Cooperation (C) and Defection (D) if the
# opponent alternates**. This prevents the opponent from exploiting you by
# mixing strategies unpredictably.  5. **If mutual cooperation (C, C) is
# sustained for at least 5 consecutive rounds**, continue cooperating unless the
# opponent defects. This maximizes the potential for high payoffs through long-
# term cooperation.  6. **Defect (D) in the last 3 rounds** to maximize end-game
# payoffs, but only if the opponent has shown a pattern of defection or if
# mutual cooperation has not been established. If mutual cooperation has been
# consistent, continue cooperating until the final round.  ---  This revised
# strategy balances aggression with adaptability. It starts with cooperation to
# avoid immediate retaliation, but quickly shifts to defection if the opponent
# defects. It also provides a clear path to rebuild cooperation if the opponent
# shows a willingness to cooperate, while maintaining an aggressive stance in
# the end-game to maximize payoffs.

# ### Revised Aggressive Iterated Game Strategy:  1. **Start with defection, but
# be ready to adapt.**      Begin by playing D (Defect) on the first move to
# test the opponentâ€™s response. This establishes an aggressive stance but allows
# for flexibility based on the opponentâ€™s behavior.  2. **If the opponent
# defects in response, switch to tit-for-tat.**      If the opponent defects
# after your initial defection, immediately switch to a tit-for-tat strategy:
# - Mirror the opponentâ€™s previous move (if they play C, you play C; if they
# play D, you play D).      This ensures you avoid prolonged mutual defection
# and can capitalize on cooperation if the opponent is willing to cooperate.  3.
# **If the opponent continues to cooperate after your defection, switch to
# cooperation.**      If the opponent plays C (Cooperate) after your initial
# defection, switch to playing C as well. This allows you to take advantage of
# mutual cooperation (3 points per round) and avoid unnecessary losses from
# continued defection.  4. **Punish defection with a single defection, then
# return to cooperation.**      If the opponent defects after a period of mutual
# cooperation, punish them by defecting once. After this, return to cooperation
# (C) to signal that you are willing to cooperate again if they stop defecting.
# This prevents long-term mutual defection while still discouraging
# exploitation.  5. **In the final 50 rounds, defect only if the opponent
# defects.**      In the last 50 rounds, continue using tit-for-tat, but be more
# cautious about defection. Only defect if the opponent defects first. This
# prevents unnecessary retaliation and maximizes potential cooperation in the
# endgame.  6. **If the opponent consistently defects, defect as well.**      If
# the opponent shows a pattern of consistent defection (e.g., 5 or more
# consecutive defections), switch to defecting exclusively. There is no benefit
# to cooperating with an opponent who is not willing to cooperate.  ---  This
# revised strategy balances early aggression with adaptability, allowing for
# cooperation when beneficial while still punishing defection. It avoids
# prolonged mutual defection and maximizes payoffs by responding flexibly to the
# opponentâ€™s behavior.

# defected in two consecutive rounds**. Otherwise, continue to play C.  3.
# **Forgive after a single defection if followed by cooperation:**    - If your
# opponent defects (plays D) but then returns to cooperation (plays C) in the
# next round, immediately return to cooperation (play C) as well.  4.
# **Introduce a "grace period" for persistent defection:**    - If your opponent
# defects for **5 consecutive rounds**, switch to defection (play D) for the
# next 5 rounds.    - After this period, test cooperation again by playing C. If
# the opponent cooperates, return to cooperation. If they defect again, switch
# to permanent defection (play D for the rest of the game).  5. **Endgame
# strategy (last 10 rounds):**    - In the final 10 rounds, defect (play D)
# regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions, as there is no future punishment
# possible.

# ### Revised Neutral Strategy for 1000-round Iterated Game:  1. **Start with

# **Tit-for-Tat with Conditional Forgiveness**: From the second round onward,
# adopt a modified "Tit-for-Tat" approach:    - **If the opponent played C in
# the previous round**, play C (Cooperate).    - **If the opponent played D in
# the previous round**, play D (Defect) in the next round.    - **If the
# opponent cooperates after you defect**, return to C (Cooperate) in the
# following round to encourage mutual cooperation.    - **If the opponent
# defects again after you defect**, continue playing D (Defect) until they
# cooperate for 2 consecutive rounds, at which point you return to C
# (Cooperate).  3. **Punish Sustained Defection**: If the opponent defects for 3
# consecutive rounds, switch to permanent defection (D) for the remainder of the
# game to avoid further exploitation.  4. **Endgame Caution**: In the last 10
# rounds, continue using the same strategy (Tit-for-Tat with Conditional
# Forgiveness) rather than switching to unconditional cooperation. This prevents
# the opponent from exploiting the endgame by defecting without consequence.
# ### Summary of Conditions: 1. Start with C. 2. Mirror the opponentâ€™s previous
# move (Tit-for-Tat). 3. Forgive after one defection if the opponent cooperates,
# but defect if they continue defecting. 4. Switch to permanent defection after
# 3 consecutive defections. 5. Maintain the same strategy in the last 10 rounds
# to avoid endgame exploitation.  This revised strategy addresses the critiques
# by introducing conditional forgiveness, punishing sustained defection more
# effectively, and maintaining caution in the endgame.

# 1. **Start with Cooperation (C)**: Begin the game by playing C. This signals a
# willingness to cooperate and avoids immediately provoking a cycle of mutual
# defection.  2. **Tit-for-Tat with Defection Bias**: After the first round,
# adopt a tit-for-tat approach with a bias toward defection. If the opponent
# plays C, respond with C in the next round. If the opponent plays D, respond
# with D in the next round. This ensures you mirror the opponentâ€™s behavior
# while maintaining a defensive stance.  3. **Punish Two Consecutive Defections
# with Extended Defection**: If the opponent defects for two consecutive rounds,
# switch to playing D for the next three rounds. This escalates the punishment
# for sustained defection, discouraging the opponent from exploiting your
# cooperation.  4. **Return to Cooperation After Punishment**: After punishing
# the opponent with three rounds of defection, return to playing C to test if
# the opponent is willing to cooperate again. This provides an opportunity to
# re-establish cooperation if the opponent is responsive.  5. **Adapt to
# Opponentâ€™s Strategy**: If the opponent consistently defects (e.g., for more
# than 10 consecutive rounds), switch to always playing D for the remainder of
# the game. This prevents you from being exploited by an opponent who is
# committed to defection.  6. **Occasional Cooperation to Test for Change**: If
# both players have been defecting for more than 20 rounds, play C once to test
# if the opponent is willing to shift to cooperation. If the opponent responds
# with C, return to tit-for-tat. If they respond with D, return to always
# defecting.  7. **Endgame Strategy**: In the final 10 rounds of the game,
# switch to always playing D regardless of the opponentâ€™s behavior. This ensures
# you maximize your payoff in the closing rounds when the incentive to defect is
# highest.

# Defections**: If your opponent defects (plays D) **once or twice in non-
# consecutive rounds**, continue following the mirroring rule. If they return to
# cooperation (play C) in the next round, **immediately return to playing C**.
# 4. **Punish Persistent Defection**: If your opponent defects for **three
# consecutive rounds**, switch to playing **D** for the next **three rounds** as
# punishment.  5. **Return to Cooperation After Punishment**: After the three-
# round punishment, if your opponent plays **C** for two consecutive rounds,
# return to playing **C** and resume the cooperative strategy.  6. **Escalate
# Defection if Opponent Continues Defecting**: If your opponent continues to
# defect after the three-round punishment (i.e., they play D for more than five
# consecutive rounds), switch to **permanent defection** (always play D) for the
# remainder of the game.  7. **Endgame Consideration**: In the final 10 rounds
# of the game, **always cooperate** unless your opponent has been defecting
# consistently. If they have been defecting in the last 10 rounds, switch to
# **permanent defection** for the remainder of the game.  This revised strategy
# balances cooperation, forgiveness, and punishment, while addressing the need
# for escalation in response to persistent defection and considering the length
# of the game.

# ### Revised Neutral Strategy for Iterated 1000-Round Game:  1. **Initial Move:
# Cooperate (C).**      Start by cooperating in the first round to establish a
# neutral and cooperative tone.  2. **Tit-for-Tat with Gradual Forgiveness:**
# - **If the opponent cooperated (C) in the previous round, continue to
# cooperate (C).**    - **If the opponent defected (D) in the previous round,
# defect (D) in the next round.**        However, if the opponent cooperates
# again after defecting, **immediately return to cooperation (C)** to encourage
# mutual cooperation.  3. **Forgiveness for Occasional Defections:**    - If the
# opponent defects (D) **once or twice in a row**, continue to follow the tit-
# for-tat approach (defect in response, then cooperate if they cooperate).    -
# If the opponent defects (D) **three times in a row**, **defect for the next 3
# rounds** to signal that repeated defection will not be tolerated. After this,
# return to cooperation (C) if the opponent cooperates again.  4. **Permanent
# Defection Only After Persistent Betrayal:**    - If the opponent defects (D)
# **five consecutive times**, switch to permanent defection (D) for the
# remainder of the game. This ensures you are not exploited by a consistently
# defecting opponent.  5. **Endgame Caution:**    - In the final 10 rounds,
# **continue to follow the tit-for-tat approach** rather than unconditionally
# cooperating. This prevents exploitation in the endgame while still allowing
# for cooperation if the opponent remains cooperative.  ### Summary: - Start by
# cooperating. - Mirror the opponentâ€™s previous move but forgive occasional
# defections by returning to cooperation if they cooperate again. - Respond to
# repeated defections with temporary retaliation, but only switch to permanent
# defection after five consecutive defections. - Maintain the tit-for-tat
# approach in the final 10 rounds to avoid endgame exploitation.
