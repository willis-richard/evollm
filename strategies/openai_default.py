# ### Strategy: Tit-for-Tat with Occasional Defection  1. **Start by cooperating
# (play C).**  2. **On the next round and every round thereafter:**    - If your
# opponent cooperated (played C) in the previous round, cooperate (play C).    -
# If your opponent defected (played D) in the previous round, defect (play D) in
# the next round.  3. **Occasionally defect to test your opponent**:    - Every
# 50 rounds, regardless of your opponent's previous move, play D (defect) once.
# This is to test if your opponent is overly cooperative and to maximise your
# potential payoff.  4. **Return to cooperation** if the opponent returns to
# cooperation after your occasional defection. Follow the standard tit-for-tat
# approach again.  ### Summary: - Start with cooperation, mirror your opponent's
# last move, and inject a defection every 50 rounds to probe for opportunities
# to exploit.

# ### Strategy: **Tit-for-Two-Tats with Initial Cooperation**  1. **Start by
# playing C (Cooperate) in the first two rounds.**    - This sets a cooperative
# tone and avoids immediate conflict.  2. **Continue to play C (Cooperate) as
# long as your opponent plays C in both of the last two rounds.**    - This
# rewards consistent cooperation from your opponent.  3. **If your opponent
# plays D (Defect) in either of the last two rounds, play D (Defect) in the next
# round.**    - This punishes occasional defection without overreacting to a
# single instance.  4. **Return to C (Cooperate) after one round of playing D if
# your opponent resumes playing C.**    - This allows for recovery of
# cooperation after brief punishment.  5. **If your opponent defects in two or
# more consecutive rounds, continue playing D until they start cooperating for
# two consecutive rounds.**    - This prevents exploitation by punishing
# sustained defection while still allowing a path back to cooperation.  ###
# Summary: - Start cooperatively and maintain cooperation unless your opponent
# defects multiple times. - Punish defection moderately but be quick to return
# to cooperation if your opponent shows willingness to cooperate again.

# ### Neutral Strategy for 1000-round Iterated Game  1. **Start with Cooperation
# (C):** In the first round, always play C to establish a cooperative tone.  2.
# **Tit-for-Tat with Forgiveness:**    - If your opponent played C in the
# previous round, continue playing C.    - If your opponent played D in the
# previous round, respond with D in the next round.    - **Forgive after one
# retaliation:** If you retaliated with D and your opponent returns to playing
# C, immediately return to playing C in the following round.  3. **Occasional
# Random Cooperation:**    - Every 50 rounds, regardless of the opponentâ€™s
# previous move, randomly play C with a 10% probability, even if you would
# otherwise have played D. This introduces uncertainty and prevents long-term
# cycles of mutual defection.  4. **Endgame Cooperation (final 10 rounds):**
# - In the last 10 rounds, always play C to signal cooperation and attempt to
# increase the overall payoff if your opponent decides to reciprocate.  This
# strategy balances between cooperation and retaliation, ensuring you don't
# suffer constant exploitation while allowing opportunities for rebuilding
# cooperation.

# opponent plays C in response to your D, continue playing D to maximize your
# score while they continue to cooperate.  3. **Switch to cooperation (C) if the
# opponent defects (D)**: If the opponent defects in response to your D, switch
# to playing C in the next round to signal potential future cooperation and test
# whether they are willing to switch to mutual cooperation.  4. **Defect again
# if mutual cooperation is not established**: If the opponent continues to play
# D after your switch to C, return to playing D and stick with it, as
# cooperation is unlikely to yield good results.  5. **Maintain mutual
# cooperation if established**: If the opponent cooperates after you switch to
# C, continue cooperating to sustain a mutually beneficial outcome.  6. **Punish
# defection with defection**: If at any point during mutual cooperation the
# opponent defects, immediately switch back to D and continue defecting until
# cooperation is restored.  7. **Endgame strategy**: In the final few rounds
# (e.g., the last 10 rounds), defect consistently regardless of the opponent's
# actions to maximize your score before the game ends.  This strategy balances
# aggression with opportunistic cooperation and ensures high payoffs in
# scenarios where the opponent is either cooperative or easily exploitable.

# Form Game:**  1. **Start with Defection (D):** Begin the first round by
# playing D to test if the opponent tends to cooperate or defect.  2. **Continue
# Defecting (D) if Opponent Cooperates (C):** If the opponent plays C while you
# play D, continue defecting in subsequent rounds to exploit their cooperation
# and maximize your score (5 points per round).  3. **Switch to Cooperation (C)
# if Opponent Defects (D) Consistently:** If the opponent responds to your
# defection with D for 3 consecutive rounds, switch to cooperation (C) to avoid
# the low payoff of mutual defection (1 point per round) and see if they begin
# cooperating.  4. **Return to Defection (D) if Opponent Defects after Your
# Cooperation:** If the opponent defects again while you're cooperating,
# immediately switch back to defection (D) to avoid being exploited.  5. **Tit-
# for-Tat but Aggressively:** After the first handful of rounds, mirror the
# opponent's previous move but with a bias towards defection. If the opponent
# cooperates, defect once to maximize your gain, but then cooperate in the
# following round to attempt to reset mutual cooperation. If they defect, return
# to defection.  6. **Endgame Aggression (Final 10 Rounds):** In the last 10
# rounds, defect consistently regardless of the opponent's behavior to maximize
# points, as there is no future punishment for defection.  This strategy
# aggressively pursues high payoffs through defection while still allowing some
# cooperation to prevent being locked in mutual defection for too long.

# Cooperative:** If your opponent plays C for 5 rounds in a row without
# defecting, switch to playing C as well. This signals a willingness to
# cooperate and capitalize on mutual cooperation if the opponent is trustworthy.
# 4. **Defect Immediately After Opponent Defects:** If you are cooperating
# (playing C) and your opponent defects (plays D) even once, immediately return
# to defection (play D). This punishes the opponent for trying to exploit you.
# 5. **Forgive but Return to Defection if Betrayed Again:** If the opponent
# defects once after a long stretch of cooperation, give them one chance by
# returning to cooperation after 5 rounds of mutual defection. If they defect
# again after this, continue defecting for the rest of the game to avoid further
# losses.  6. **Endgame Defection:** In the final 10 rounds, defect consistently

# gain when future cooperation is irrelevant.  This strategy exploits opponents
# who are too cooperative while still offering the chance for mutual long-term

# defection**: If the opponent defects for two consecutive rounds, switch to
# defection (play D) and continue defecting until the opponent returns to
# cooperation (plays C). Once they cooperate again, mirror their move as usual.
# 5. **Endgame cooperation**: In the last 5 rounds, always cooperate regardless
# of past behavior to maximize potential mutual benefit in the final rounds.
# This prevents a spiral of mutual defection as the game nears its end.  ###
# Summary: - Start by cooperating. - Mirror the opponent's last move. - Forgive
# a single defection after long cooperation. - Defect after two consecutive
# defections but return to cooperation if they do. - Cooperate in the final 5
# rounds.

# ### Aggressive Strategy for a 1000-Round Iterated Game:  1. **Start by playing
# D (Defect) in the first round.**    - This sets an aggressive tone and tests
# your opponentâ€™s responsiveness.  2. **In subsequent rounds, play D (Defect)
# again unless the opponent consistently plays C (Cooperate) for three
# consecutive rounds.**    - If the opponent plays C three times in a row,
# switch to C in the next round to test for mutual cooperation.     3. **If
# mutual cooperation (both playing C) is established, continue playing C as long
# as the opponent continues to play C.**    - This allows you to capitalize on
# the payoff of 3 points each round for as long as cooperation holds.  4.
# **Immediately switch back to D if the opponent defects (plays D) at any
# point.**    - Once the opponent defects, play D for the remainder of the game
# unless the opponent re-establishes cooperative behavior for another three
# consecutive rounds.  5. **In the final 5 rounds, always play D regardless of
# prior cooperation.**    - This ensures you maximize points toward the end of
# the game, where the opponent may attempt to defect for a final advantage.  ---
# This strategy balances an aggressive approach with the opportunity to exploit
# cooperation if the opponent is willing. It punishes defection quickly but
# leaves room for returning to mutual cooperation if it benefits overall payoff.

# opponent's previous move.**      - If they played C (cooperate) in Round 1,
# you play C in Round 2.      - If they played D (defect) in Round 1, you play D
# again in Round 2.  3. **Continue mirroring until Round 10.**      - For rounds
# 3 to 10, continue to copy your opponent's previous move. This will establish a
# pattern of reciprocity and signal that you are willing to mirror their
# behavior.  4. **Round 11: Defect regardless of their move.**      - In Round
# 11, defect again, regardless of your opponent's previous action. This
# introduces unpredictability and tests their willingness to cooperate.  5.
# **Rounds 12-30: Return to mirroring their previous move.**      - After the
# defection in Round 11, go back to copying your opponentâ€™s previous move for
# the next 18 rounds. This reinforces the idea that you're willing to cooperate
# if they do, but will retaliate if they defect.  6. **Round 31: Defect again.**
# - In Round 31, defect regardless of their move. This again tests their resolve
# and willingness to cooperate over the long run.  7. **Rounds 32-100: Continue
# mirroring their move but defect every 20th round.**      - For rounds 32 to
# 100, mirror their previous move but make sure to defect on every 20th round
# (i.e., rounds 51, 71, and 91).  8. **Rounds 101-1000: Mirror but defect every
# 50th round.**      - For the remainder of the game, continue the strategy of
# mirroring your opponentâ€™s previous move, but defect on every 50th round (i.e.,
# rounds 150, 200, 250, etc.).  9. **Final 10 rounds (Rounds 991-1000): Defect
# every round.**      - In the last 10 rounds, defect every round to maximize
# your final payoff, regardless of your opponent's actions.  This strategy is
# aggressive, as it starts with defection and periodically injects defection
# throughout the game, while still maintaining an overall cooperative approach.

# ### Neutral Strategy for Maximising Payoff:  1. **Initial Cooperation**: Begin

# previous action. This gives the opponent an opportunity to return to

# your defection by also playing D, switch to playing C (Cooperate) in the next
# round. This signals a willingness to cooperate if the opponent does the same,
# avoiding the low payoff of mutual defection.  4. **Return to Defection if

# switched to C, revert back to playing D. There's no benefit to cooperating if

# Defection if Opponent Cooperates**: If the opponent begins cooperating after

# ### Neutral Strategy for Maximizing Payoff in a 1000-Round Iterated Game  1.
# **Initial Move**: Start by playing **C** (cooperate) in the first round. This
# sets a cooperative tone and encourages mutual benefit.  2. **Tit-for-Tat
# Basis**: For each subsequent round, mimic your opponentâ€™s last move:    - If
# your opponent played **C** in the previous round, play **C** in the current
# round.    - If your opponent played **D** in the previous round, play **D** in
# the current round.  3. **Occasional Forgiveness**: Every 10 rounds, if your
# opponent has consistently defected (played **D**), attempt to re-establish
# cooperation by playing **C** once. This gives your opponent a chance to switch
# back to cooperation.  4. **Punishment for Sustained Defection**: If your
# opponent continues to defect for 5 consecutive rounds after an attempt at
# forgiveness, switch to playing **D** for the remainder of the game to minimize
# losses.  5. **Endgame Consideration**: In the final 5 rounds, always play
# **D** regardless of your opponentâ€™s behavior, as there is no future incentive
# to maintain cooperation.  ---  This strategy balances the potential for
# cooperative gains with cautious retaliation and forgiveness. It adapts to the
# opponentâ€™s behavior while ensuring protection against sustained exploitation.

# to Cooperation (C) if Opponent Defects Twice in a Row:** If your opponent
# plays D for two consecutive rounds, switch to C to test if mutual cooperation
# can increase your overall score.  4. **Return to Defection (D) if Opponent
# Defects After You Cooperate:** If you play C and your opponent responds with
# D, immediately switch back to D and continue defecting for the rest of the
# game against that opponent.  5. **Alternate Strategy if Opponent Cooperates
# After Defection:** If after your initial defection, your opponent switches to
# D and then starts cooperating after a few rounds, mirror their strategy by
# alternating between C and D to create uncertainty and prevent them from
# settling on pure cooperation.   6. **Endgame Aggression:** In the final 50
# rounds, defect consistently (D) regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions to
# maximize your payoff in the closing stages of the game.  This strategy
# leverages early aggression to test the opponent's willingness to cooperate,

# (cooperate) in the next round to give them a chance to cooperate again.  4.
# **Sustained Defection**: If the opponent defects twice in a row, switch to
# playing **D** indefinitely, assuming that sustained cooperation is unlikely.

# the time by round 500, switch to playing **D** for the remainder of the game.
# This strategy balances cooperation with retaliation and forgiveness, while

# payoffs, as future cooperation becomes irrelevant when the game is about to

# ### Strategy Outline: "Tit-for-Tat with Occasional Forgiveness"  1. **Start
# with Cooperation**: In the first round, play **C** (Cooperate).  2. **Tit-for-
# Tat Response**:     - In subsequent rounds, **mirror your opponent's last
# move**.       - If they played **C**, respond with **C**.      - If they
# played **D**, respond with **D**.  3. **Forgiveness Mechanism**:     - Every
# 10 rounds, if your opponent has defected at least once in the last 5 rounds,
# **forgive once** by playing **C**, regardless of their last move.    - This
# occasional forgiveness helps restore cooperation, especially in cases where
# mutual defection might otherwise persist.  4. **Final Rounds Rule (Rounds
# 990-1000)**:     - In the last 10 rounds, **defect unconditionally** by
# playing **D** every round. This ensures you maximize points at the end of the
# game when the opponent may be tempted to defect as well.  ### Summary - Begin
# with cooperation. - Mirror your opponentâ€™s previous move (Tit-for-Tat). -
# Forgive once every 10 rounds if your opponent has defected recently. - Defect
# in the final 10 rounds to secure higher payoffs.

# 1. **Start by Defecting**: In the first round, play D (Defect) to test the
# opponentâ€™s response and secure a potential advantage if they cooperate.  2.
# **Continue Defecting if the Opponent Cooperates**: If the opponent plays C
# (Cooperate) while you play D, continue defecting to maximize your payoff. The
# opponent is showing a cooperative tendency, which you can exploit for as long
# as possible.  3. **Switch to Cooperation if the Opponent Defects in
# Response**: If the opponent plays D in response to your defection, switch to C
# (Cooperate) for the next round to signal a willingness to change strategies.
# This helps avoid falling into a mutual defection pattern that yields low
# payoffs for both players.  4. **Retaliate if the Opponent Defects Again**: If
# the opponent continues to defect after you switch to cooperation, immediately
# defect in the following round. This establishes that you will not tolerate
# repeated defection without consequence.  5. **Alternate Between Cooperation
# and Defection Based on the Opponentâ€™s Actions**: If the opponent shows signs
# of alternating between cooperation and defection, adopt a Tit-for-Tat
# approach: cooperate if they cooperate, defect if they defect. This ensures you
# avoid exploitation while maintaining the possibility of maximizing mutual
# cooperation.  6. **Shift to Pure Defection in the Final 50 Rounds**: Starting
# from round 951, defect every round regardless of the opponentâ€™s actions. Since
# the game is nearing its end, there is no long-term consequence for defecting,
# and you should maximize short-term gains.

# ### Aggressive Strategy: Conditional Defection for Maximum Payoff  1. **Start
# with Defect (D):** In the first round, play D. This sets an aggressive tone,
# aiming to avoid being exploited early by a cooperative opponent.  2.
# **Continue with Defect (D) unless opponent defects two times consecutively:**
# - If the opponent plays D in two consecutive rounds, consider the possibility
# of a tit-for-tat or retaliatory strategy. Switch to cooperation (C) to test if
# they are willing to return to a cooperative stance.  3. **Switch to
# Cooperation (C) for two rounds after consecutive defections by the opponent:**
# - If the opponent defects twice in a row, play C for the next two rounds to
# signal a willingness to cooperate.    - If the opponent cooperates (plays C
# both rounds), continue playing C as long as mutual cooperation persists.  4.
# **Revert to Defect (D) after opponent defects when you cooperate:**    - If
# the opponent defects even once during your cooperative phase (after you have
# played C), immediately switch back to full defection (D) for the rest of the
# game. This will punish any attempt to exploit your cooperation.  5. **Never
# return to cooperation after a betrayal in a cooperative phase:**    - If an
# opponent defects during a cooperative phase, maintain defect (D) for the
# remainder of the game, as trust has been broken.  6. **In the final 10 rounds,
# defect (D) regardless of previous outcomes:**    - To maximize final payoffs,
# always defect in the last 10 rounds. At this point, cooperation is less likely
# to be rewarded, and defecting ensures your opponent cannot exploit you in the
# closing rounds.  ### Summary: - Start aggressive with D. - Defect unless the
# opponent shows consistent cooperation after a retaliatory phase. - Punish
# defectors permanently. - Defect in the final 10 rounds for maximum payoff.

# (Cooperate) for two consecutive rounds.**    - If the opponent plays C twice
# in a row, this suggests they may be willing to cooperate, and you can exploit
# this.  3. **Once the opponent has played C twice consecutively, switch to
# playing C.**    - This transition is to encourage mutual cooperation and gain
# a higher, consistent payoff (3 per round) rather than the lower payoff (1 per
# round) from mutual defection.  4. **If the opponent defects (plays D) in
# response to your cooperation, immediately switch back to D and continue
# defecting for the next 10 rounds.**    - This punishes their defection by
# ensuring that both players score low (1 point) during this period, dissuading
# them from defecting again.  5. **After 10 rounds of mutual defection, if the

# to step 3 and cooperate.**    - This allows for the possibility of re-
# establishing mutual cooperation for better payoffs.  6. **In the final 10

# you maximize your score at the end without risking exploitation, as the

# cooperating**: In the first round, play C.  2. **Mirror the opponentâ€™s
# previous move**: From the second round onward, do the following:    - If the
# opponent played C in the previous round, play C (cooperate).    - If the
# opponent played D in the previous round, play D (defect).  3. **Forgive
# occasional defections**: If the opponent defects only once after multiple
# rounds of cooperation (i.e., they revert to cooperation in the next round),
# forgive by returning to cooperation (play C). However, if they defect again
# after the forgiveness, return to mirroring their moves (play D after their D).
# 4. **Sustained punishment for consistent defection**: If the opponent defects
# in two consecutive rounds or more, continue to defect (play D) until they
# cooperate for two consecutive rounds. Only after two consecutive cooperations
# should you return to cooperation.  5. **Endgame (final 50 rounds)**: In the
# last 50 rounds, prioritize cooperation (play C) regardless of the opponentâ€™s
# behavior to maximize mutual payoff, unless they consistently defect in this
# phase (in that case, mirror their moves).  ---  This strategy encourages
# cooperation but includes punishment and forgiveness mechanisms to guard
# against exploitation, while still allowing recovery from mistakes.

# defects once or twice in a row, continue cooperating (*C*).      - If your
# opponent defects three times consecutively, switch to *D* (Defect) in the next
# round.  3. **Return to Cooperation**:    - After retaliating by defecting
# once, revert to playing *C* in the following round, regardless of your
# opponentâ€™s move.    - If your opponent resumes cooperation, continue playing
# *C*.    - If they defect again, follow the same main rule (allow two
# defections before retaliating).  4. **Endgame (Rounds 990-1000)**:    - From
# round 990 onwards, unconditionally cooperate (*C*) to encourage cooperation in
# the final rounds and avoid a mutual spiral of defections.  This strategy
# balances cooperation and retaliation, encouraging long-term mutual cooperation

# points for you, 0 for them). This maximizes your score while they are
# cooperating.  3. **Switch to Cooperation (C) if Opponent Defects**: If the
# opponent plays D in response to your D, switch to playing C for the next round
# to signal a willingness to cooperate and potentially avoid mutual defection,
# which only gives you 1 point.  4. **Reciprocate Cooperation**: If the opponent
# responds to your C by playing C as well, maintain cooperation (continue
# playing C) to secure a steady payoff of 3 points per round.  5. **Punish
# Immediate Defection**: If the opponent defects after you have cooperated,
# immediately switch back to playing D and continue defecting until they show a
# willingness to cooperate again.  6. **Occasional Defection (Tit-for-Tat with
# Occasional Aggression)**: Every 50 rounds, regardless of the opponent's
# behavior, defect once to test if the opponent will continue cooperating or
# retaliate. This prevents the opponent from taking your cooperation for granted
# while keeping the possibility of future cooperation open.  7. **Endgame
# Defection**: In the last 10 rounds, defect consistently (D in every round) to
# maximize your score without concern for future retaliation, as the game is
# about to end.  This strategy leverages initial aggression to extract high
# payoffs, while allowing for the possibility of cooperation to avoid long-term

# ### Strategy Overview: "Tit-for-Tat with Occasional Forgiveness"  1. **Start

# **Mimic the Opponent:**    - From the second round onwards, mirror the
# opponentâ€™s previous move:      - If the opponent played C in the previous
# round, play C.      - If the opponent played D in the previous round, play D.
# 3. **Occasional Forgiveness:**    - Every 10 rounds, check if you have been
# defecting (playing D) for 3 consecutive rounds. If so, play C in the next
# round regardless of the opponent's prior move. This gives the opponent a
# chance to return to cooperation if they are stuck in a cycle of mutual
# defection.     4. **Adjust to Opponentâ€™s Behavior:**    - If the opponent
# consistently defects (plays D for 10 or more consecutive rounds), switch to
# playing D for the remainder of the game to minimize losses.  5. **Final Rounds
# (990 to 1000):**    - In the last 10 rounds, always defect (D) to maximize
# your endgame payoff, as the opponent may also shift to a more aggressive
# stance near the gameâ€™s conclusion.  ### Summary: - Start with cooperation. -
# Mirror the opponentâ€™s previous move. - Occasionally forgive prolonged mutual
# defection. - Defect in the final 10 rounds to secure higher payoffs.

# round (plays D), cooperate on the next round (play C).**      This is to test
# if the opponent can be coaxed into cooperating, allowing for a more profitable
# outcome.  4. **If the opponent defects in response to your cooperation, defect
# on all future rounds.**      If they continue to defect, itâ€™s clear they are
# not open to cooperation, and mutual defection guarantees a minimal but stable
# payoff (1 point each round).  5. **If the opponent cooperates after your
# cooperation, alternate between cooperating (C) and defecting (D) every two
# rounds.**      This pattern allows you to exploit the benefits of cooperation
# while still keeping a higher payoff over time.  6. **If the opponent at any

# defecting ensures you avoid being exploited further.  This strategy balances
# aggression and opportunistic cooperation to maximize payoffs, while quickly
# punishing opponents who attempt to exploit your cooperation.

# (C):** If, after any round, the opponent plays C while you play D, continue
# playing D to exploit their cooperation and maximize your payoff.  3. **Switch
# to cooperation (C) if opponent defects (D):** If the opponent defects after
# you defect (i.e., both play D), switch to playing C in the next round. This
# change signals a willingness to cooperate and potentially exploit any future
# cooperation from the opponent.  4. **Return to defection (D) if opponent
# defects again (D):** If the opponent defects while you are cooperating (i.e.,
# you play C and they play D), switch back to defection in all subsequent rounds
# to avoid being exploited.  5. **Alternate between cooperation (C) and
# defection (D) based on opponentâ€™s behavior:** If the opponent begins
# cooperating consistently after you switch to defection, consider alternating
# between cooperation and defection every few rounds to balance exploitation and
# cooperation.  6. **Persistently defect in the final 50 rounds:** In the last
# 50 rounds, defect consistently to maximize short-term gains, as the endgame
# reduces the benefit of establishing long-term cooperation.  This strategy is
# designed to exploit cooperative opponents while avoiding prolonged punishment
# from defectors, with an aggressive focus on gaining higher payoffs through
# defection whenever feasible.

# cooperate.**    - If both you and your opponent play C in the previous round,
# continue playing C in the next round.  3. **Punish defection with immediate
# defection.**    - If your opponent plays D in any round, respond with D in the
# next round. This discourages your opponent from exploiting your cooperation.
# 4. **Forgive after one round of mutual defection.**    - After one round where
# both you and your opponent play D (mutual defection), return to playing C in
# the next round. This signals that you are willing to return to cooperation if
# your opponent does the same.  5. **Never cooperate if the opponent defects
# twice in a row.**    - If your opponent defects in two consecutive rounds,
# continue playing D indefinitely to avoid repeated exploitation.  6. **In the
# final 10 rounds, always defect.**    - Starting from round 991, play D in
# every round, as the game is ending and cooperation is no longer incentivized.
# ### Summary: - Cooperate unless punished. - Punish defectors once, then
# forgive. - Defect permanently if the opponent shows sustained defection. -
# Defect in the final 10 rounds.

# ### Aggressive Iterated Strategy  1. **Start by playing D (Defect) in the
# first round** â€“ This sets an aggressive tone and immediately maximizes your
# one-round payoff if your opponent starts with cooperation (C).  2. **Continue
# playing D as long as the opponent plays C** â€“ Exploit every opportunity to
# gain 5 points while they score 0. Keep defecting as long as they cooperate.
# 3. **Switch to C (Cooperate) after 5 rounds of mutual defection (D,D)** â€“ If
# both players defect for 5 consecutive rounds, switch to cooperation to test if
# the opponent will also cooperate. This prevents both players from getting
# stuck in a low-scoring (D,D) cycle, which gives only 1 point each.  4.
# **Return to D immediately if the opponent defects after you switch to C** â€“
# Punish any defection from your opponent. Every time they defect while you
# cooperate, revert to D and stay aggressive by defecting in subsequent rounds.
# 5. **Alternate between C and D if the opponent alternates** â€“ If the opponent
# starts alternating between cooperation and defection, mirror their behavior;
# play D when they play C and C when they play D. This minimizes their score
# while keeping your score relatively high.  6. **End the game aggressively by
# defecting in the last 3 rounds** â€“ If the opponent has been cooperating
# consistently, defect in the final 3 rounds to maximize your score without fear
# of retaliation since the game is ending.  ---  This strategy seeks to maximize
# your payoff by exploiting cooperation from the opponent while also offering
# brief chances for cooperation if mutual defection becomes unproductive.

# rounds, play D in every round to maximize your score, as cooperation is less
# valuable when the game is close to ending and retaliation for defection has
# minimal impact.  ### Summary of Conditions: - **Round 1:** Play C. - **Round
# 2-989:** Play your opponent's last move (C if they played C, D if they played
# D), with forgiveness if they return to cooperation. - **Every 50 rounds:**
# Defect once to test your opponent. - **Rounds 990-1000:** Defect in every
# round.  This strategy balances cooperation with cautious defection to maximize
# long-term payoffs while minimizing exploitation.

# plays C in any round, immediately follow up with D in the next round to
# exploit their cooperation and score 5 points.  3. **Tit-for-Tat with Defection
# Bias:**      If your opponent plays D, continue to play D. This ensures that
# you avoid being exploited and maintain a baseline score of 1.  4. **Occasional
# Cooperation (C) After Extended Defection:**      Every 50 rounds, play C once
# to test if the opponent might switch to cooperation. If they reciprocate with
# C, play C for the next 3 rounds to boost mutual scores. If they defect during
# this period, immediately return to D.  5. **Endgame Strategy (Final 50
# Rounds):**      In the last 50 rounds, consistently play D regardless of prior
# cooperation or defection to ensure you donâ€™t risk being exploited in the final
# phase of the game.  This strategy leverages aggression to maximize
# exploitation while occasionally probing for opportunities to cooperate if the
# opponent shows signs of long-term cooperation.

# defects (D) three times in a row.**      This signals that the opponent is not
# willing to cooperate and repeated mutual defection (D, D) only gives both
# players a low payoff (1). By switching to cooperation, you open the
# possibility of mutual cooperation (C, C) for a better overall payoff of 3 each
# if they follow suit.  4. **Return to Defection (D) if the opponent defects (D)
# after your cooperation (C).**      This punishes the opponent for not
# reciprocating your cooperative gesture, ensuring you do not fall into a
# pattern where you consistently lose out by cooperating while they defect.  5.
# **Alternate between Cooperation (C) and Defection (D) if the opponent mirrors
# your behaviour exactly.**      If the opponent is mimicking your moves (i.e.,
# playing C when you play C and D when you play D), alternate between
# cooperation and defection to keep them guessing and prevent them from
# exploiting a predictable pattern.  6. **End with Defection (D) in the final 10
# rounds.**      As the game approaches the end, shift to consistent defection
# to maximise your points in the final rounds, since future reprisals from the
# opponent are no longer a concern.  This strategy seeks to exploit early
# cooperative opponents while adapting to more aggressive ones, ensuring a
# relatively high payoff throughout the game.

# your opponent have cooperated in the previous round.  3. **If your opponent
# defects** (plays D) in any round, immediately retaliate by defecting (play D)
# in the next round.  4. **After retaliating once, return to cooperation** (play
# C) in the following round, regardless of your opponent's move.  5. **If your
# opponent continues to defect for two consecutive rounds**, switch to defecting
# (play D) until they cooperate again.  6. **Once your opponent cooperates
# again**, return to step 2 and resume cooperation.  This strategy balances
# cooperation and retaliation, aiming to sustain mutual cooperation while
# punishing defection briefly, but not excessively.
